Drafting Classes are noted in the schedule below. If you do not complete the required at-home draft work in preparation for the drafting class, please take the drafting class to catch up on your work on your own. Without the required materials completed for the drafting class, there is no point in attending because drafting classes are workshop-based and require having the completed materials. If you don't have the required draft work, you cannot participate. If you attend a drafting class without the required materials, I will ask you to leave before beginning the workshop; no hard feelings or judgement.

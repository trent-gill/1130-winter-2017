Summarizing

A summary should be a short version of a longer original source. Its main goal is to present a large amount of information in a short and concise text that includes only the most important ideas of the original text.

Example

Original Source:

“The movement toward education by computer is developing fast. Massive Open Online Courses, called MOOCs, are changing how people learn in many places. For years, people could receive study materials from colleges or universities and take part in online classes. But such classes were not designed for many thousands of students at one time, as MOOCs are.” (Richards; Page 32 "MOOCS Are Moving Forward," *Voice of America*, learningenglish.voanews.com)

Inappropriate Summary:

Voice of America website: Computer education is growing fast. MOOCs are influencing how we study. People received materials from universities for a long time to be able to take classes online. MOOCs are the only ones thousands can take at a time.(Richards 32).

Appropriate Summary:

 According to Richards, a fast-growing MOOCs movement allows thousands to take online classes at once, changing how we learn (32).

The appropriate summary keeps the original main idea and it is much shorter than the original text.

Other Examples:

1. Mr. Leibovitz and writer Matthew Miller joined forces to tell the story of the students in their book, “Fortunate Sons.” The book says China sent one hundred twenty boys to America to learn about developments that could help modernize their country.” (72)

Possible Solution: “Fortunate Sons” tells the story of Chinese exchange students who came to the US in the 1870s to learn how to help China. Many Chinese students are doing the same today (72).

2. “Illiteracy is a problem in many of the world’s poorest countries.  Even in wealthier nations like the United States, many children struggle with reading and writing.  But in 19 cities across the country [United States], the volunteers of Experience Corps are helping youngsters learn to read.  The volunteers, all over 50, work with students in low-income areas.” (John Woo / Page 45-47)

Possible Solution: Older Experience Corps volunteers help poor children from 19 US cities improve their literacy skills (Woo 45-7).

3. “Women entrepreneurs in the developing world often face challenges that limit their chances for success and growth. They often have less access to education than men and have difficulty getting financing on their own. But with an understanding of the essential aspects of doing business – such as planning, financing, networking and marketing – they can overcome those obstacles. That's where the 10,000 Women Initiative comes in. As Faiza Elmasry tells us, it's an investment in education with dividends that benefit the businesswomen, their local communities and their national economies.” (Joan Peterson, Vij Rajan, Alastar Cho / Pages 59 - 60)

Possible Solution: The 10,000 Women Initiative helps women entrepreneurs in developing nations to understand the cornerstones of the business world, overcoming various challenges and helping their communities and countries (Cho et al. 59-60).

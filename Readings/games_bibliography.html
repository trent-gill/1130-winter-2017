the effects of game technology on student learning in mathematics as investigated in two data sets collected from slightly different subjects. In the first, 41 second graders (7 or 8 years old) from two classes used either a technology- based game or a paper-based game for 5 weeks. For the next 13 weeks, both classes used a technology-based game either two times per week, or more than three times per week. A quasi-experimental control-group design with repeated measures analysis of variance and analysis of covariance was employed to explore performance differences between groups. The second study examined student learning in relation to characteristics such as their game performance, attitudes toward the game and toward mathematics, and gender and ethnicity. During a 4-month period, 50 second grade students from three classes played a technology-based game under conditions that varied depending on their teacher's direction. Multiple regression was used to determine the relationship between students' arithmetic scores and learner characteristics. Descriptive analyses by ability level, gender and ethnicity, and interview data about attitudes toward the technology game were also analyzed. Results from the two studies revealed that using a technologybased game in the classroom was beneficial to students of all ability levels in learning arithmetic skills.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">What is already known about this topic</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* Technology and games have yielded consistently positive results with regard to motivation, persistence, curiosity, attention and attitude toward learning.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* The accessibility and flexibility of handheld devices can provide students with more integral and spontaneous opportunities to fully take advantage of "off-moments" from classroom activity to support learning.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* There are insufficient data to validate the contribution of technology to student learning.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">What this paper adds</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* This paper provides evidence that game technology positively impacts elementary students' learning of arithmetic, regardless of ability level.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* The paper proposes research-based design principles, generated from a literature review, to guide the development of individualized technology game environments to support student learning.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* This paper suggests various research methodologies to provide empirical evidence of the impact of technology on academic achievement.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Implications for practice and/or policy</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* To select appropriate games for target students, practitioners should consider the importance of clear goals and rules, flexible learner control and tasks at an appropriate level of challenge for the learner, with feedback provided.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* Teachers are more likely to implement technology if learning goals meet state or federally mandated standards for which teachers are already accountable.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* Identifying significant classroom variables (eg. teacher, student and classroom variables) is an important step in successfully implementing technology in educational settings.

For example, research using meta-analysis on the impact of technology on reading and mathematics reported that only a small number of rigorous, published studies contrast traditional and technology learning conditions for K-12 students (Dynarski et al, 2007). The results of most studies in game technology were considered too fragmented and unsystematic (Condie &amp; Munro, 2007; Randel, Morris, Wetzel, &amp; Whitehill, 1992). The evidence is insufficient that using technology positively affected teaching and learning. Thus, the call continues for more and better empirical evidence of the impact of technology on academic achievement (Chandra &amp; Lloyd, 2008; Dynarski et al, 2007; Means, Toyama, Murphy, Bakia &amp; Jones, 2009).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In response to the call for additional empiric evidence on the use of technology in teaching and learning, we designed two studies to investigate whether game technology facilitates learning in elementary mathematics and to explore which aspects of game design support student learning. We first reviewed research literature that explores how game technology influences student learning. Next, we developed a technology-based game using design principles generated from the review. We then conducted two quantitative studies using the technology-based arithmetic game and a paper-based game, both with the same learning goals, in order to explore the effects of game technology on student learning. This paper begins with a literature review focused on the relationship between game technology and learning,and uses that framework to propose design principles for the development of technology-based games.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Game technology and learning</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Learning refers to the active construction of an individual's own knowledge by integrating new information with previous experience (Bransford, Brown &amp; Cocking, 2000). Researchers in the learning progression field propose that because learners have different personal and cultural experiences, they can follow many paths as they move from novice toward expert understanding (Duschl, Schweingruber &amp; Shouse, 2007; Shin, Stevens &amp; Krajcik, 2010). Thus, given the same learning goals, different students learn in different ways in a classroom environment, differing in the ways they perceive and comprehend information and requiring very different ways of approaching and understanding content (Sutherland, Shin &amp; McCall, 2010). Therefore, the traditional medium of print is too limiting to meet the challenges of diverse learners' needs. For example, print materials present information for typical learners using one mode of representation (a visual mode such as pictures or text) without providing appropriate supports for individuals who learn best through other modes (eg. audio or video). Educational materials withmultiple representations (eg. text, picture, video, animation/simulation, audio), various difficulty levels of learning tasks and different levels of support are necessary to appeal to the abilities, interests and needs of individual learners (Rose, Meyer &amp; Hitchcock, 2005). As one way to address individualized materials, educators have integrated technology in games that enable students to manage the acquisition of new information based on their prior knowledge and experience, learning progress, learning style, preferences and needs (Condie &amp; Munro, 2007). Research has shown that game features including clear goal/rules, learner control, challenging tasks/feedback and repetition enable educators to create individualized learning environments wherein students are able to take more active control of their learning and improve their achievement vis-à-vis desired learning goals (Condie &amp; Munro, 2007; Dempsey, Haynes, Lucassen &amp; Casey, 2002). Each of these game features and the research supporting it are described below.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Goal/rules</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Games should guide learners by defining clear learning goals and specific rules. The rules of a game specify how a learner is to accomplish game goals within the limited game environment (Garris, Ahlers &amp; Driskell, 2002). Understanding goals and rules supports student cognitive development, especially organizational skills and abstract thinking. Learners need to develop a mental structure to understand the underlying concepts of a game including its goals/rules, procedures, properties and conditions (Garris et al, 2002). The development of such a mental structure facilitates the development of organizational skills (Vygotsky, 1978). In addition, playing games enhances abstract thinking such as organizing ideas with particular properties into groups and creating sophisticated generalizations such as finding patterns (Piaget &amp; Inhelder, 1967). Technology-based games make extensive use of symbols and other abstractions; therefore, to be successful, the learner needs to understand the symbolic meaning of objects in a game and use the symbols and general strategies to formhypotheses and to experiment. Vygotsky believed that performing actions according to rules and symbolic understanding is a valuable experience for children, as the process of understanding symbolic meaning is considered the first step toward abstract thinking (1978). Research has shown that the goals and rules adopted by learners during a learning task influence both their performance and their motivation (Locke &amp; Latham, 1990; Urdan &amp; Maehr, 1995;Wolters,Yu &amp; Pintrich, 1996). These findings support the notion that those educational games that contain clear and specific goals and rules lead to enhanced performance and learning outcomes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Learner control</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Games should allow learners to control their own activity and to direct or command elements of the game. Learner control is defined as the ability of learners to regulate learning activities based on their learning styles, strategies, and previous experience and knowledge (Quintana, Shin, Norris &amp; Soloway, 2006). Vygotsky proposed that individuals construct a variety of internal developmental processeswhen they are interacting with others ina learning environment (1978). The functionality of learner control in games facilitates an interaction between student and technology, which is the important factor for creating an individualized learning environment to promote student learning (Kahveci &amp; Imamoglu, 2007; Wagner, 1994). For example, students might make decisions about the topics and difficulty level of the activity based on their ability level, task goals and game strategies (Carter, 1993; Kinzie &amp; Joseph, 2008). Having control is an important aspect of subject matter mastery, motivation and positive attitude toward learning activities (Blumenfeld, Kempler &amp; Krajcik, 2006). Research on learner control has yielded consistently positive results with regard to motivation and learning (Cordova&amp;Lepper, 1996; Eck, 2006; Morrison, Ross &amp; Baldwin, 1992).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Challenge tasks/feedback</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Vygotsky advocated the notion of the zone of proximal development (ZPD) in the learning process, suggesting that learning is facilitated when individuals face activities that lie just outside of their ability (1978). On the basis of this principle, games need to offer tasks that are more challenging than students' previous accomplishments. When students work on challenging tasks using game technology, their motivation to compete against and improve their own previous scores increases (Inal &amp; Cagiltay, 2007). Along with task challenge, games should also provide feedback (eg. embedded expert guides) to support the learner in reaching goals. A crucial point in feedback is a game's response to the actions of a learner in an intelligent way in order to encourage the learner and to guide his or her behavior toward an optimal learning goal (Wagner, 1994). Games might provide feedback based on the student's correct or incorrect individual answers, on the number of correctly solved problems out of the total score or on other factors that enable the student to either pass or fail to move on to the next level. Such feedback helps learners to evaluate whether their current performance meets established goals and to reflect on past performance (Whitehall &amp; McDonald, 1993). Learners can then seek to improve their performance in order to reduce the discrepancy between goals and performance (Kernan &amp; Lord, 1990). This learning process allows learners to keep track of their progress toward desired goals and leads to increased effort and performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Repetition</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Games should call for repetitive play and repeated return to the gaming activity across time. Repetition allows learners to evaluate their performance based on trial-and-error strategies and encourages them to persist or to intensify their effort to complete required tasks (Thomas &amp; Macredie, 1994). Research indicates that these repetitive activities influence greater achievement (Garris et al, 2002).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Research literature supports the notion that game technology promotes student learning of important ideas and skills, positive motivation, persistence, curiosity, attention and attitude toward learning (Becker, 2007; Rieber, 1996; Vogel et al, 2006; Whitehall &amp; McDonald, 1993). Moreover, research suggests that game technology improves student performance on algebra and mathematics problem solving (McFarlane, Sparowhawk &amp; Heald, 2002), reading comprehension, spelling and decoding of grammar (Rosas et al, 2002), and complex thinking skills including problem solving, strategic planning and self-regulation (Cordova &amp; Lepper, 1996; Ricci, Salas &amp; Cannon-Bowers, 1996). Although there is potential in the use of game technology as an individualized learning tool, research findings with regard to the effectiveness of educational game technology in classroom learning are mixed (Condie &amp; Munro, 2007; Vogel et al, 2006); limited robust research exists on the use of technology-based games and the application of gaming skills and techniques in educational contexts. Further research is necessary to provide evidence of the effects of game technology on student learning in classrooms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Purpose of the study</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The primary purpose of this researchwas to investigate the effects of game technology on student learning of mathematics in the elementary classroom. Two studies were designed to investigate the following questions:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* How does student performance on an arithmetic skills assessment vary for students using a technology-based game and students using a non-technology-based game?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* How does student performance on an arithmetic skills assessment differ depending on whether they play the technology-based game twice or play more than three times per week?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* What is the relationship between students' performance on a technology-based arithmetic game (high/low) and their performance on a related skills assessment?</p><a id="AN0077387235-4" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_36" title="Method and results">Method and results</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Materials</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Research has determined that to learn advanced mathematics (eg. solving problems, understanding other concepts in mathematics), students must, with quality instruction, master basic arithmetic skills (such as addition and subtraction) in the early stages of the learning experience (Bloom, 1956; Hoon, Chong &amp; Binti Ngah, 2010). Research has also shown that game technology may be an optimal teaching and learning approach to facilitate student learning of basic mathematics skills such as arithmetic (Christmann &amp; Badgett, 2003; Condie &amp; Munro, 2007; Miller &amp; Robertson, 2010).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Technology-based game: GameBoy™ Skills Arena</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">An educational game program called Skills Arena (GoKnow Learning, Dallas, TX, USA) was developed to teach students about basic arithmetic skills using the GameBoy™ (Nintendo Co., Kyoto, Japan) system. GameBoy may well enable the provision of individualized instruction because its size makes it easy for children to handle (Shin, Norris &amp; Soloway, 2006). The accessibility and flexibility of GameBoy can provide students with more integral and spontaneous opportunities to fully take advantage of "off-moments" from classroom activity to support learning (Finn &amp; Vandenham, 2004). In designing the program, we used ideas from the literature about the importance of clear goals and rules; flexible learner control; tasks at an appropriate level of challenge, with feedback; and repetition (Garris et al, 2002; Quintana et al, 2006; Thomas &amp; Macredie, 1994;Wagner, 1994).We specified learning goals of the game program that directly linked to curriculum objectives and specific concepts or skills. Researchers propose that teachers are more likely to implement technology if learning goals meet state or federally mandated standards for which teachers are already accountable (Norris, Shin &amp; Soloway, 2007).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In Skills Arena, students create their own characters and identities (ie. name). We developed several features according to the design principles of having appropriate levels of challenge tasks for diverse learners and having flexible learner control. For example, students are able to select a game type from among three choices: "Mental," "Extension" and "Place" games. The Mental game is the easiest, dealing only with single digit numbers such as "&amp;lowbar;&amp;lowbar; + 3 = 10." The Extension game is moderately difficult, incorporating tasks such as "&amp;lowbar;&amp;lowbar;300 + 400 = " or "260 - 50 = ." The Place game is the highest level. It employs multiple-digit numbers without zeros such as "245 + 563 = " or "437 - 36 = ." Each game has three options for arithmetic tasks: addition, subtraction, and mixed addition and subtraction. The arithmetic problems in Skills Arena are composed of one-, two-, three- and four-digit numbers. Students need to solve the problems before the questions fade out on the GameBoy screen. In addition to game type and arithmetic task, the game has options for six speed levels, presented in the form of cartoon characters. As students answer a question, they receive immediate feedback as to whether they have answered correctly or incorrectly. The game displays a performance summary immediately after each game ends. The summary shows the total number of problems attempted and the number correctly solved. It also tracks and displays the total number attempted and correctly solved for the individual over time (see Figure 1a). This feature was intended to provide appropriate feedback to students in an intelligent way based on their performance on game tasks.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Paper-based game: flash fact cards</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The flash fact card is a triangle-shaped card with three numbers, one on each angle, and both an addition and subtraction sign in the middle of the card (see Figure 1b). A pair of students is teamed as partners. One student holds a card by hiding one of the three numbers and asks the other student what number is hidden on the card. The other student in the pair answers the question using the two remaining numbers and one of the arithmetic signs (plus or minus) on the card. The teacher directs students to practice either addition or subtraction before students begin to play. Students repeat the procedure with all the cards that the questioner has and then switch roles.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The essential cognitive processes of the both the paper-based games and the technology-based games are similar in that a student needs to calculate a correct answer using two numbers and an arithmetic sign without any support. The target school had already been using the flash fact cards to teach arithmetic skills for second grade students. Given that the cognitive process, the learning goals and the target students of the Skills Arena,GameBoy is identical to those of the flash fact cards and that both are considered learning games, we believed it valid to compare the two methods in terms of their ability to support the learning of arithmetic. Another reason for comparing the two methods is that the school principal and teachers perceived the technology-based gameto be better for practicing arithmetic skills and wanted to use the GameBoy for all second grade students. This study was designed to determine whether it is, in fact, the case that the technology-based game improves student learning.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study One: comparison between use and non-use, and more and less technology</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This study has used a quasi-experimental control-group design with repeated measures to investigate the first two research questions: (1) how do students' performances vary between a technology-based and a paper-based game during a 5-week period? and (2) how do students' performances differ when they play the game two times per week compared with playing more than three times perweek during a 13-week period? During the 5-week period, the study provided information regarding the performance differences between the technology-based and nontechnologybased game groups. The 13-week period was intended to explore the performance differences in relation to the frequency of playing the technology-based game per week. The rationale of the 13-week research design is to investigate the appropriate amount of playing time to efficiently maximize the effects of game technology on student learning.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The participants in Study One were 41 second grade students (7 or 8 years old) from two classes (out of three classes of second grade students in the school) attending a public elementary school near a large city in the Midwest. The third class is excluded in the research because the class composition and size were markedly different from the other two classes, in that it combined first (n = 9) and second (n = 9) grade students, and the sample size of nine second graders may not be enough to conduct statistical analysis for comparing their performances with those of other two classes for a 4-month period. Students were primarily upper-middle class and included 24 male and 17 female students. School records indicate that 28 students were white, seven were Asian, two were African-American and four were "other."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study conditions and procedures</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Because one research question focused on determining the value added of a technology-based game, itwas important that both the GameBoy (GB) group and the card and GameBoy (CG) group played the arithmetic game--whether technology based or paper based--for the same amount of time. The students in the GB used the Skills Arena software program. Before administering the pretest, we had students practice using the GameBoy game for 15 minutes each day for 10 days. Two investigators conducted a 1-hour training session for teachers and students on how to use the GameBoy game. Although most students had previous experience playing games on the GameBoy, some of them required additional guidelines for playing the arithmetic game. After that, students played Skills Arena on the GameBoy for 15 minutes in their mathematics class, three times per week for 5 weeks. After 5 weeks, the students played the game for 15 minutes, twice per week for 13 weeks (see Table 1). The teacher instructed students to play the game after she had finished the regular lesson. The students were kept from playing the game except for the designated period.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The students in the CG group played the addition and subtraction flash fact cards game for 15 minutes in their mathematics class, three times per week. The teacher instructed students to play the flash fact cards game after she finished the regular lesson. After 5 weeks, the students played the GameBoy game for the remaining 13 weeks of the semester. The first 10 days with GameBoy, students in the CG group played the game the same as those in the GB group. Following that, they played the game for 15 minutes, more than three times per week, in essence to enable them to "catch up" in the amount of time they used the technology-based game. Furthermore, students were allowed to play the game anytime they finished their other class assignments (see Table 1). The teachers discussed the two conditions and decided which option they would implement in their own classrooms. GB was composed of the class of 20 students. CG consisted of the class of 21 students. The pretest was administered under the supervision of teachers and two investigators before instruction began. After each period of gaming (the initial 5-week period and the second 13-week period), teachers and investigators administered the 5-week test and the final test in the two classes, respectively (see Table 1). During the implementation stage of the technologybased game, a researcher and an assistant conducted classroom observations of the GB and CG classes twice per week. We did not develop an instrument for observing teaching practices because the scope of this study did not include evaluating participants' teaching of the mathematics class. Instead, during the 5-weeks of instruction, the classroom observation focused on ensuring that the Skills Arena game was implemented in GB as intended. For CG, the observation was to guarantee that students' arithmetic skill practice hours would be the same as in GB. Observations revealed that there was no difference in time devoted to arithmetic skill practice between CG and GB. During the 13-week period, the classroom observation was conducted to confirm that the GB students played the game consistently in an appropriate way, and the Skills Arena game was precisely implemented in CG. Our observation verified that the technology-based game was implemented in CG and GB as intended.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Instruments</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A 70-item instrument was developed to assess arithmetic skills as a learning outcome in this study (see Table 2). The test had two sections. Part I consisted of 50 questions with 25 addition items and 25 subtraction items to measure basic arithmetic skills. Part II of the test had 20 questions, including 10 addition and 10 subtraction items, designed to assess advanced arithmetic skills. The students took Part I of the test in 15 minutes and Part II in 5 minutes. Participating teachers confirmed that the instruments were aligned with the mathematics standards for second grade students.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Data analysis</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Two male students from GB and one male student from CG were excluded from the analysis because they did not take one or more of the assessments: the pretest, the five-week test or the final test. One female student from GB was discounted because she transferred to another school. Thirty-seven students from the two groups were included in this analysis. This was a quasiexperimental control-group design with repeated measures. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to analyze student data, as appropriate when all students in groups are measured multiple times under different conditions, and the measurement of the dependent variable is repeated (Vonesh &amp; Chinchilli, 1997). The repeated measures ANOVA allowed researchers to monitor how students in the two groups' performance changed over three measurements during a 4-month period. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted, treating students' prior knowledge as a covariate variable, enabled researchers to compare the scores of two groups on the 5-week and the 13-week assessments. Effect sizes obtained from the two groups (by calculating the difference between adjusted means with pooled adjusted mean standard deviations) provided additional information about student performance. Assumptions for the ANCOVA statistical measures were checked using Levene's test for equality of variances between the groups. The homogeneity-of-regression (slopes) assumption of the relationship between the covariate and the dependent variable was also examined. The data for the all students as well as for the lower level students as a subgroup met the assumptions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The analysis for lower level student performancewas conducted using repeated measures ANOVA and ANCOVA with only lower level students from both of the groups. The lower level group consists of the students who had scores lower than 42 on the pretest. Although the mean of pretest score of the both groups was around 37, a close look at frequencies revealed two distinct clusters of higher and lower level students. The frequency of the pretest scores with all students was distributed evenly across 12 and 57 except between 22 and 28, and 41 and 46. No student scored between those two score ranges. The 42 cutoff point was appropriate for determining higher and lower level groupings because if we were to use 22 as the cutoff point, there were insufficient students (less than 30%) to conduct statistical analysis by ability level. Determining high and low ability using 42 as the score around which actual scores clustered meant that 50% of the students could be classified as lower performing and 50% classified as higher performing. However, the sample size of each low-level group (n = 10 from GB and n = 11 from CG) using 42 was relatively small. Assumptions for the statistical measureswere checked using Levene's test for equality of variances among the groups. The data for the low-level samples met the assumptions. The statistical analysis was interpreted to examine the effects of the technology-based game on low-level students.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Results and discussion</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Descriptive statistics for the two groups are shown in Table 3. Overall, the scores of the male students in the both groupswere higher than those of females across three tests.White and Asian students performed better than African-American students. Table 4 summarizes the results of the repeated measures ANOVA analysis. The column labeled F gives the F value of the test followed by three columns of significance values.Arepeated measures ANOVA with a Greenhouse-Geisser correction determined that mean of total arithmetic test scores differed between the three time points (pre, 5-week and final test) at statistically significant levels: F (2, 70) = 33.38, p = 0.000. There was a significant interaction between the three time points and the groups (GB and CG), F (2, 70) = 4.57, p = 0.014. The statistical interaction results indicated that students' performances depended on their use of the game technology. As shown in Figure 2a, the direction of a relation between two groups is different depending on the use of game technology. When students used or played the technology-based game more, their performance was higher than that of students who did not use the technology-based game or who played it less often.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the 5-week period, the GB students gained 11% (M = 7.65, standard deviation [SD] = 7.84) from the pretest to the 5-week test. In the case of CG, students increased only 4% (M = 2.85, SD = 6.48) on the tests. A one-way ANCOVA was conducted to compare the scores of two groups on the 5-week test. The independent variable, group level, included two levels: CG and GB. The dependent variable was the students' arithmetic scores on the 5-week test, and the covariate was the students' scores on the pretest. An analysis evaluating the homogeneity-of-regression (slopes) assumption indicated that the relationship between the covariate and the dependent variable did not differ significantly as a function of the independent variable, F (1, 33) = 2.96, p = 0.095. The underlying assumption of homogeneity of variance for the one-way ANCOVA has been met--as evidenced by F (1, 35) = 0.29, p = 0.596. The ANCOVA was significant, F (1, 34) = 4.24, p = 0.047 (see Table 5). A follow-up test using the Bonferroni procedure was conducted to evaluate differences of the adjusted means for group level. The results showed that GB students (M = 44.70) had significantly higher arithmetic scores, controlling for the effect of their pretest, than CG students (M = 39.90). The effect size for the significant adjusted mean difference was 2.06, which indicates a large effect size (Cohen, 1988) (see Table 5). In the next 13-week period, the CG students increased 11% (M = 7.70, SD = 6.12) from the 5-week test to the final test. The GB students increased only 1%(M = 0.82, SD = 6.54) on the tests. The ANCOVA results using the 5-week scores as a covariate variable showed that CG outperformed GB, F (1, 34) = 10.07, p = 0.003. The results of the follow-up test using the adjusted means for group level showed that CG students (M = 49.77) had significantly higher arithmetic scores, controlling for the effect of their 5-week test, than GB students (M = 42.98). The effect size for the significant adjusted mean difference was 3.17, considered a large effect size (see Table 5).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The results of repeated measures ANOVA with only low-level students revealed that mean of total arithmetic test scores differed between the three time points at statistically significant levels: F (2, 38) = 22.82, p = 0.000 (see Table 4). There was a significant interaction between the three time points and the group,F(2, 38) = 3.43, p = 0.043 (see Figure 2b).TheGBlow-level students gained 16% (M = 11.50, SD = 7.12) from the pretest to the 5-week test. In case of CG, students increased only5%(M = 3.45, SD = 8.34) on the tests.The ANCOVAresults of the 5-week test scores showed thatGBoutperformedCG:F(1, 18) = 5.16, p = 0.036 (seeTable 5).Theresults of the follow-uptest showed that GB lower level students (M = 37.50) had significantly higher arithmetic scores, controlling for the effect of their pretest, than CG lower level students (M = 29.73). The effect size for the significant adjusted mean differencewas 2.27,whichwas considered large. In the 13-week period, the CG low-level students increased 12% (M = 8.18, SD = 7.32) from the 5-week test to the final test. The GB low-level students increased approximately 0% (M = 0.30, SD = 7.64) on the tests. The ANCOVA results showed that therewere statistically significant differences in test scores between the groups during the 13-week gaming: F (1, 18) = 4.95, p = 0.039 (see Table 5). The follow-up test results showed that CG low-level students (M = 41.64) had significantly higher arithmetic scores, controlling for the effect of their 5-week test, than GB low-level students (M = 33.69).The effect size for the significant adjustedmeandifferencewas 2.22,whichwas large.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We ran descriptive statistics to compare student performance by gender, even though the sample size is small. In the 5-week gaming period, the GB female students' gain scores (M = 11.62) were twice as high as those forCGfemales (M = 5.75). In thesameperiod, theGBmales (M = 4.1) gained only three points more than the CG males (M = 1.00). In the 13-week period, both women (M = 6.25) and men (M = 8.58) in CG gained substantially more than those in GB (M = 0.25 for females M = 1.34 for males). The trend in females' scores across the three tests indicated that low-level females' performancewas positively influenced by the use of the technology-based game. GB females increased their score fromM = 34.65 on the pretest toM = 46.25 on the 5-week test. Their scores on the 5-week test were higher than the cutoff point (42) dividing the low- and high-level group's scores. However, after reaching a high-level score, their scores did not increase from the 5-week to the final test. In contrast, the CG females who scored lower than 42 on the pretest and the 5-week test consistently improved their scores across the three tests. The CG males who scored more than 42 on the pretest substantially increased their scores after playing the technology-based game during the 13-week gaming period, while the GB males who had lower than42scores showed a trivial improvement.These results suggest that gametechnology might be effective in supporting low-performing female students in learning basic arithmetic skills. Results also suggest that game technology might be beneficial in supporting high-performing males in learning basic arithmetic skills. Further study is merited to generalize the results with larger and more diverse students aswell as to investigatewhy game technology seems to more positively affect lower performing female and higher performing male students. For example, specific aspects of student attributes such as level of competitiveness and confidence in mathematics, or attitude toward group work, are necessary for analyzing student's performance by gender in depth.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In sum, the results of the scores between the pretest and the 5-week test revealed that students who used the technology-based game outperformed those who did not use it. Comparison of the 5-week and the final test results revealed that students who played the technology-based game more than three times per week outperformed those who used the game only twice each week. The trends for low-level students as a subgroup were the same as those for all students.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, in order to reach firm conclusions about the effects of game technology on student learning, further investigation must continue to explore the results of this study. First, the 13-week results might have been influenced by other factors such as motivation toward the game and competence in using the game. For example, students in the two groups might have different degrees of motivation toward the technology-based game before starting the 13-week gaming. The GB students might have lowmotivation toward the game because they had already used it for 5 weeks. In contrast, CG students might have higher motivation than those of GB students because of the novelty of using the game and the GameBoy.We employed an ANCOVA statistical technique to control for prior performance differences between the groups but did not measure and control motivation and competence differences toward the technology-based game in the 13-week analysis.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, we need further investigation to explore the lack of progress of GB students from the 5-week to the final test despite 13 weeks of using the game. We speculate three possible reasons for the results: first, because the novelty of using the game wears off during the 4-month period, the GB students' motivation toward the game might decrease, resulting in a no-gain score. Second, twice weekly use of the game may sustain students' arithmetic skills, but may not be sufficient for improving their skills. Technology should be integrated seamlessly into the school curriculum as a routine learning activity for successful implementation in classrooms. However, the twice-a-week schedule of playing arithmetic games might not be sufficient for establishing the use of game technology as an integral part of the classroom learning experience. Third, students' scores on the final test might be a factor of their developmental growth rather than the effects of game technology. That is, with or without using a technology-based game, 7-or 8-year-old children might be typically able to reach only a certain arithmetic skills level developmentally (eg. correctly answer around 50 of 70 items).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, the nonsignificant difference between two groups on the final test score requires additional exploration. The results are congruent with those of the final game score (see Table 3). No statistically significant differences emerged between the two groups on the cumulative number of problems solved or of problems solved correctly as indicated by the GameBoy game scores. These results suggest that either the number of problems attempted or number of correctly solved problems may influence students' scores on the arithmetic test regardless of frequency of playing the game (twice vs. more than three times per week), or duration in using the technology-based game (18 weeks vs. 13 weeks). Developmental growth may also help to explain the lack of significance in the two groups' results on the final test. It may be that the effects of game technology are limited in promoting drill-and-practice learning tasks (eg. arithmetic skills), in part, because students typically can only reach a certain level based on their developmental stage regardless of using game technology. We also speculate that our three tests during the 4-month period might not sufficiently discriminate students' learning progress. The 70 items might not include an appropriate range of item difficulty. For example, the 20 items in Part II might be too difficult to answer correctly within 5 minutes. The instrument might lack sufficient middle-level items for measuring student performance in the score range between 50 and 70.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To answer these questions and to confirm our speculations from the first study, additional research using a randomized control trial with control and treatment groups for a longer period time, with a well-developed test and a larger sample size is necessary. In addition, student data regarding attitude toward and competence in using the game are needed in conjunction with administration of the arithmetic tests (eg. pretest, five-week test and final test). Such study can informwhether our test adequately discriminated the effects of game technology over a 4-month period. Such study might also provide information as to the reasons for students' gain scores, whether the gains originate from students' developmental growth or from the effects of game technology.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Study two: relationship between learner characteristics and learning using a technology-based game The purpose of Study Two was to explore relationships between student characteristics (gender, ethnicity, attitude toward mathematics, attitude toward the game, game performance) and student learning in a game technology environment. Study Two was designed to investigate: how do students' performances on a technology-based game influence student learning of arithmetic skills? This question was investigated to determine whether particular characteristics could predict students' arithmetic scores. More specifically, if game performance can predict (at a level of statistical significance) students' scores on an arithmetic test, we can then determine that game technology influences student learning in mathematics.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants in this study included the 41 students from Study One as well as the nine students from class three who were omitted from Study One analysis. The third class is included in this research design because the rationale of the research design was to explore the relationship between students' game scores in GameBoy and student's scores in the arithmetic test regardless of their class conditions for using the game. In Study Two,we treated individual characteristics as important variables and did not intend to compare students' performances between three class gaming conditions. The 50 second graders from three classes of 21, 20 and 9 students each, included 28 male and 22 female students. School records indicated race/ethnicity of the students as follows: white (n = 31), African-American (n = 6), Asian (n = 8), Hispanic (n = 1) and other (n = 4) (see Table 6 for detail).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Instrument</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The subjects' attitude toward mathematics was measured using the attitude toward math survey. This survey, developed by Pearce, Lungren and Wince (1999), is comprised of 23 positive and negative statements about young students' attitudes toward mathematics. We used this survey because it was developed at an age-appropriate level for lower elementary students. The teachers presented statements to students orally. Students responded by marking "yes" or "no" on their answer sheet in response to each statement. An eight-item debriefing questionnaire was developed to capture students' perceptions regarding attitudes toward elements of the game. The items were a combination of six "Yes or No" and two open-ended questions (see Table 7). Participating teachers confirmed that the instruments were at an appropriate readability level for second grade students. The 70-item instrument developed in Study One was used to assess arithmetic skills as a learning outcome (see Table 2).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Procedures</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Fifty second grade students from three classes used a GameBoy with the Skills Arena software program under three conditions including three times per week for 5 weeks followed by two times per week for 13 weeks over an 18-week period, more than three times per week over a 13-week period or more than four times per week over an 8-week period (see Table 6). We designed three conditions to ensure that each group would spend approximately the same amount of time playing with the technology-based game. Thus, the primary difference among three groups was the frequency and the duration in using the technology-based game, keeping a total amount of playing time the same approximately. The students in Class One and ClassTwo played the game as described in Study One. The students in Class Three played the GameBoy game more than four times per week for 8 weeks. Instructions for playing the game were the same as those of GB in Study One. The teachers and investigators administered the final test in the three classes. The teachers administered the survey of students' attitudes toward mathematics. A researcher collected students' responses of the debriefing questionnaire through individual interviews with each participant after administrating the final test.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Data analysis</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Multiple regression (a nonexperimental, correlational analysis) was used to test the relationship between students' arithmetic scores and the predictor variables including attitude toward the game and toward mathematics, ethnicity, gender and game scores (number of correctly solved problems). Pearson correlation coefficients were computed for the entire sample in order to detect violation of the data assumptions (multicollinearity among the independent variables: correlation higher than 0.70) for conductingmultiple regression (see Table 8). The mathematic attitude scores were significantly related to those of game attitude, at p ??0.05. However, there was no potential problem using the data in the analyses.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Results and discussion</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Table 9 presents means and standard deviations of the three groups' performances on the arithmetic test, GameBoy game, and attitude toward mathematics and the game. The students in Class Two had slightly higher scores on the test than those of Class One and Class Three. Their mathematic and game attitude scores were higher than those of Class One and Class Three as well. Class One had the lowest test, game and mathematic attitude score. On the basis of those results, we assume that the implementation of the game in Class One might be problematic. Further investigation is necessary to explore why and how the Class One conditions for using the game were not effective compared with the other two conditions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Female students (n = 21,M = 41.62,SD = 17.00) in all three groups performedsignificantly lower than male students (n = 28, M = 50.79, SD = 13.85) on the test: t (47) = 2.08, p ??0.05. Asian students had the highest scores among all ethnic groups and African-American students scored lowest. As shown in Table 3, the pretest scores for Class One and Class Two, in Study One, considered by genderandby ethnicity, revealed a similar patternto those in StudyTwo (seeTables 3 and 9).We suspect that the performancedifferences between males and females, andamongethnic groups resulted from their prior experiences rather than from the gaming activity itself. That is, the differences seen at the pretest level for white, African-American and Asian students in mathematics, and for boys and girls in mathematics, have been shown in other research; thus, students' use of a technology-based game did not "create" the differences in performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For the multiple regression analysis, the first step of the analysis used all the predictor variables simultaneously, including attitude toward mathematics, attitude toward the GameBoy game, game scores, gender and ethnicity in the model. The results show that two variables, game scores (β = 0.43, t = 3.58, p = 0.001) and attitude toward mathematics (β = 0.37, t = 3.03, p = 0.004), emerged as significant predictors of arithmetic test scores. To reduce the error associated with the inclusion of nonsignificant predictors in regression models, only the significant predictors from the first regression analysis were used in the second step of the analysis. In this step, game scores (β = 0.48, t = 4.32, p = 0.000) and attitude toward mathematics (β = 0.40, t = 3.52, p = 0.001) accounted for 45% (p ??0.001) of the variance in arithmetic test scores (see Table 10). The overall plot and normal probability plot of residuals indicated that the results of this study met the assumptions of multiple regression analysis. Additionally, the results of the cross-validation technique confirmed that the prediction equation of the arithmetic scores works for students other than those who were used to develop the equation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Overall, the cumulative number of problems solved correctly, as indicated by the GameBoy game scores, and the students' attitude toward mathematics significantly correlated with the students' scores on the arithmetic final test. Attitude toward the GameBoy game, gender and ethnicitywere not significant predictors of test scores. Students who had higher scores on the GameBoy game were more likely to achieve high scores on the arithmetic test regardless of gender, ethnicity or attitude toward the GameBoy game. Therefore, game performance did influence students' scores on the arithmetic test. However, because of the limited sample size, we did not run statistical analysis to compare student performance between the three groups. The results of no differences between the three groups on the final test scores require further research. The findings are consistent with those of Study One regarding the differences on the final test between CG and GB. We speculate that there was possibly a teacher effect, in which the teaching practices of the three teachers might have influenced student learning of arithmetic. Additional qualitative data (eg. classroom observation) is necessary to explore the relationship between the teaching practices of the teachers and student learning. A future study using randomized controlled trials with three groups and one teacher would provide information on whether the frequency and duration of using the game influences student learning independent of teacher effect.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Lastly, we analyzed students' responses on two open-ended interview questions (see Table 6). Students' responses when asked about their "favorite thing about the game" can be organized into three categories: motivation, learning and game features (see Table 11). Sixteen students (33%) responded that they had fun playing the game. Sixteen students (33%) responded that they like the game because it helps their learning. Seventeen students (35%) reported that their favorite thing about the game was its features including various game tasks, creating their own character and learner control. Student responses suggest that the technology-based game promoted positive attitudes toward learning and motivation because it provided various options that students could choose based on their individual needs. To the question about their least favorite thing about the game, 20 students (41%) responded positively in the perspective of motivation. Eighteen students (37%) responded that the game tasks are difficult, so they could not get a perfect score. Two students (4%) reported that they did not have sufficient time playing the game. Responses suggest that the game tasks were designed at an appropriate level of challenge so that the students repeated the tasks until they moved up to the next level rather than gave up on the tasks. Six students (12%) had negative responses to some game features and program errors. They reported that the game was boring because they had to repeat the easy game before going on to the next level. Students who had a negative reaction to making their own character did not elaborate on the reasons they disliked the feature. The student feedback provided us with information for revising the game in two ways. First, when students need to repeat the same level task, the repeated task should focus only on items that the student answered incorrectly rather than repeating all items at that level. Second, the game needs to have more character options so that students have a wider variety from which to choose.</p><a id="AN0077387235-5" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_82" title="Conclusion and future directions">Conclusion and future directions</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The purpose of this investigation was to explore the effects of game technology on student learning in mathematics. The results of two quantitative studies provide evidence that game technology positively impacts elementary students' learning of arithmetic regardless of ability level. Study One showed that given two types of arithmetic games for practice, students who played a technology-based game outperformed those who played a paper-based game, and students who played more outperformed those who played the game less frequently, regardless of student ability level. Study Two provided evidence that the technology-based game influenced student's arithmetic learning. The two studies support claims made in previous literature that game technology incorporating essential game features could be an effective learning tool for students to manage the acquisition of new information, depending on their prior knowledge and experience, learning progress, learning style, preferences and needs (Condie &amp; Munro, 2007; Cordova &amp; Lepper, 1996; McFarlane et al, 2002; Rosas et al, 2002).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Based on these findings,we suggest three important areas for further study of the impact of game technology on student learning. First, further research is needed to examine how game features should be designed to promote individualized instruction for enhancing learning outcomes of complex cognitive tasks, student interest and engagement in gaming environments. In the current study, we investigated the effects of technology-based games on student learning but did not examine relationships between various game features and the learning process. For example, research should examine the extent to which task-specific goals influence engagement in game activity and enhance student interest. In addition, qualitative research is necessary to understand how each game feature impacts cognitive engagement. In Skills Arena, students created their own characters and names for playing the game. Future research needs to investigate how the character creation feature influences student engagement, motivation, interest and learning outcomes. Such research is critical to providing more specific guidelines for game design.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, identifying significant classroom variables is an important step in successfully implementing games in educational settings. Classroom environments are complex; they are influenced by teacher variables (eg. teaching style, experience in incorporating technology in instruction, attitude toward the use of games), student variables (eg. gender, ethnicity, learning styles, strategies, and prior experience with content, game playing, and technology) and classroom variables (eg. number of students, number of technology devices, type of technology). Further research is needed to understand how such variables influence learners' engagement in games and which circumstances are most advantageous for successfully implementing technology-based games in classrooms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Third, researchers need to explore the effectiveness of technology-based games on higher order thinking skills such as creativity, problem solving and decision making. We designed the game used in this study to support drill and practice in arithmetic because even though it is a low-level skill, mastery is a critical learning goal at this grade level, and class time is typically devoted to engaging in drill and practice exercises in a paper format. More research is needed to provide guidance on how designers can develop individualized technology game environments for development of advanced skills. To do this, designers need to further develop games with higher order thinking as the target learning goal and fully utilizing the affordances of game technology vis-àvis various learning theories. Lastly, more extensive study with a larger sample size and sampling procedure are necessary in order to generalize the results of this study about the effects of game technology on student learning.</p><a id="AN0077387235-6" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_87" title="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The authors wish to thank the teachers who gave us valuable feedback and continuous support to collect high-quality data from their classes.

She and her partner complete a "Conservation of Matter" lab using a triple beam balance and LEGOs. This activity is worth 100 experience points (XPs) toward her next 3D GameLab badge. First, Colette imports the PDF for the lab sheet into the writing app, Notability. The quest starts with a short video developed by Mr. Wallen that shows how to use a triple beam balance. The students begin the lab using materials to experiment and iPads to record information.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Colette enlarges the response box, using pinch-to-zoom, allowing her to easily control the space to finger-write her hypothesis. She and her partner use the iPad to sketch their observations using shape boxes and colors and adjusting line widths as needed. When writing the lab conclusions, the girls struggle to answer the question, "What is the conservation of matter?" They do not know the definition of conservation. Colette exits to the home screen and opens the dictionary app. She types in "conservation" and reads the definition aloud several times, discussing ideas with her partner. Swiping back to Notability, she rereads the question, "What is conservation of matter?" She continues to multitask, swiping back and forth from the definition to the lab question until she feels confident about her response.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Colette and her partner record their lab findings in a new note on the class Padlet wall (see https://padlet.com), instantly uploading their activity for the class to view. When the lab is complete, Colette takes a screenshot of her lab sheet, uploads the image, and submits her work electronically to her teacher.</p><a id="AN0103382681-5" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_9" title="Gamification for Learning">Gamification for Learning</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The scenario with Colette describes a typical student experience in Mr. Wallen's gamified classroom.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Nearly all of today's adolescents (ages 12-17) are gamers who primarily play games socially in household or online environments (Lenhart et al., 2008). Gaming, in real or virtual worlds, can provide motivation for students to complete tasks (Glover, 2013; Lee &amp; Hammer, 2011). Gee (2007) has argued that well-designed games engage the player in complex and critical thinking, embodying dispositions necessary for 21st-century learners.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Game-based learning (GBL), or the use of video games for educational purposes, has been shown to be an effective means of enhancing both learning motivation and academic performance (Chang, Wu, Weng, &amp; Sung, 2012; Chun-Hung et al., 2013; Virvou, Katsionis, &amp; Manos, 2005). The 21st-century literacy skills involved in GBL allow information and communication technologies (ICTs) to become increasingly social and user-centric, with Internet users no longer sole consumers of information but also producers of information (Simöes, Redondo, &amp; Vilas, 2013). Through 3D GameLab and various apps, Mr. Wallen has created a unique way to teach science and literacy skills through technology. Colette must blend knowledge of science content, literacy, and specific technology skills to complete the gaming quest described in the opening scenario.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A newer concept to GBL is the notion of gamification, which incorporates attributes of GBL in nongame applications (Simöes et al., 2013). Gamification may involve the teacher gamifying an activity or teaching a concept by including mechanics such as achievement badges, levels, and XPs for mastering a given level (see Bunchball, 2010, for common gaming elements), thus increasing student engagement without ties to any one specific game. Students are, therefore, learning content and practicing literacy skills as if they were playing a game, making the educational experience both challenging and fun (Vassileva, 2008 ).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The purpose of this article is to examine how gamification, coupled with effective pedagogy, can support the acquisition of 21st-century skills. The following questions frame our study:</p><ol xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><li><span class="medium-normal"> How can gamification support the multimodal and social nature of new literacies?</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> How does gamification provide opportunities for creativity, critical thinking, communication, and collaboration?</span></li></ol><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the following, we discuss the theoretical framework, New Literacies theory, that has informed our case study of one teacher 's journey using gamification. Additional discussion will place this framework within two educational reforms and initiatives: the Common Core State Standards and Partnership for 21st Century Skills (P21).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We begin our observation analysis by first sharing Mr. Wallen's transformation to gamification. In doing so, we highlight essential qualities of gamification. Second, we provide snapshots of the integration of new literacies skills into 3D GameLab, arranging these examples according to P21's Learning and Innovation Skills category. Third, we report learner perceptions of the 3D GameLab platform, sharing results from our survey with Mr. Wallen 's students. Finally, we discuss implications for teachers who wish to meet student needs and state literacy requirements through a gamified learning experience.</p><a id="AN0103382681-6" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_18" title="New Literacies: Multiple, Multimodal, and Multifaceted">New Literacies: Multiple, Multimodal, and Multifaceted</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Generally speaking, new literacies refers to literacies enabled by digital or Internet technologies. Accurately defining the term is difficult, if not impossible, because new literacies are, by nature, rapidly changing and situational (Leu et al., 2015). Leu, Kinzer, Coiro, Castek, and Henry (2013) addressed the conundrum of this evolving context within two levels: New Literacies (uppercase) and new literacies (lowercase). Lowercase theories inform specific areas of study or new technologies, such as practices associated with ICTs (Kingsley &amp; Tancock, 2014; Leu, Kinzer, Coiro, &amp; Cammack, 2004). Common findings within lowercase new literacies research inform and guide the development of principles within uppercase New Literacies. This study explores a specific area of lowercase new literacies, gamification, as a means to contribute to the ever-expanding theory of uppercase New Literacies. Thus, this study is situated within both contextual levels.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">One key principle of New Literacies acknowledges new literacies as multiple, multimodal, and multifaceted (Leu et al., 2013) . The New London Group (2000) places multiliteracies within various communication modes, including linguistic, auditory, spatial, visual, and gestural. Books, games, and digital media are all modes of literacy requiring readers to both take in and make meaning (Gee, 2013). Thus, our discussion of multiliteracies includes multiple modes and contexts. New Literacies theory recognizes research within multimodality theory and asserts that new literacies involve reading, examining, and creating with both print and digital texts (Jewitt &amp; Kress, 2003; Kress, 2003). Creating and comprehending multimedia messages is the key to multimedia literacy (Mayer, 2008). Learners today, many using 1:1 devices, are able to engage in multimodal digital composing, using both linguistic and media modes to create and share artifacts (Dalton, 2013).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Further, new social practices evolve from the use of new literacies (Leu et al., 2013). The characteristics and combination of New Literacies creates a new, contemporary mind-set, fully acclimatized within Web 2.0 modalities. Central to this principle is what Lankshear and Knobel (2006) refer to as the ethos of new literacies, meaning new literacies are more participatory, collaborative, and distributed when compared with conventional literacies. They argued that simply fitting new technologies into standard classroom practices may allow students to learn a particular technology at the surface level rather than embed technology within everyday social practices. These surface-) evel attempts to technologize learning (e.g., using PowerPoint instead of a poster to present information) tend to "perpetuate the old, rather than to engage with and refine or reinvent the new" (p. 55). Thus, in order for literacy to be considered new, it must be embedded within authentic situations and used to promote 21st-century student outcomes.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Gee's (2004) recognition of learning within affinity spaces (physical or virtual) contributes to the multifaceted and social nature of New Literacies. Affinity spaces are shared social spaces, used to connect with others and pursue interests. Members of affinity groups understand the group' s identities and social norms. These spaces foster collaboration and typify the ethos of new literacies.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Capitalizing on multiliteracies requires a shifting mind-set of schooling, one that incorporates play, imagination, the unpredictability of learning, and a fun learning environment (Jacobs, 2014). This study examines the use of gamification as a means to embody the multifaceted, multimodal, and social aspects of New Literacies. Games can be structured to create a virtual reality in which students use new literacies skills to navigate through and participate within multiple formats and modalities (Apperley &amp; Walsh, 2012).</p><a id="AN0103382681-7" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_24" title="New Standards and Initiatives">New Standards and Initiatives</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Informing the present study are national education reforms, which notably recognize the advancement of new literacies. First, the Common Core State Standards (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices &amp; Council of Chief State School Officers [NGA Center &amp; CCSSO], 2010) promotes new literacies skills. The English Language Arts Anchor Standards require higher order thinking through complex texts, close reading, and vocabulary acquisition, with an increased emphasis on expository text. Anchor Standards include the use of digital tools to produce and publish writing, draw inferences and evidence from text, and conduct research. These Standards represent the advancement and promotion of both critical thinking and digital literacy skills in K-12 education.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Second, P21 (2009a) has developed a framework incorporating 21st-century learning. This collected vision describes the "skills, knowledge and expertise students must master to succeed in work and life; it is a blend of content knowledge, specific skills, expertise and literacies" (p. 1). No longer are the three Rs of reading, writing, and arithmetic sufficient for students, who must develop the skills necessary to compete in today's global economy. Rather, an integration of the content subject knowledge, along with what P21 refers to as the 4Cs -- critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity -- will prepare students for 21st-century learning.</p><a id="AN0103382681-8" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_27" title="Our Methods">Our Methods</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For the present case study (Creswell, 2014), we completed data collection over four weeks while Mr. Wallen's classes participated in a technology-based, gamified science unit. A mixed-methods approach was used to observe the interactions within the online and real-life classrooms (Venkatesh, Brown, &amp; Bala, 2013). Data were collected through classroom observations, analysis of the gamified learning environment, semistructured interviews with the teacher, and a survey of students (Creswell, 2011, 2014). Students in Mr. Wallen's class were surveyed about using iPads, 3D GameLab, and gamification of learning (n = 47). Questions were open-ended (two questions) or Likert-scale (10 questions) covering motivation, instruction, and preference.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Mr. Wallen was one of two teachers within a large, Midwestern metropolitan intermediate school (grades 5 and 6) chosen to implement 1:1 iPad technology in the classroom. His four science rotations were diverse and of mixed abilities, including general education students, high-ability students, and students with identified learning disabilities. Overall, school demographics indicate that 20% of students receive free or reduced-price lunch. Approximately 70% of students were of white/non-Hispanic origin.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Within the curriculum, we examined ICTs use, the gamification platform, and the teacher-designed content, structures, and activities. Time logs and event recordings were used for the descriptive observation of real-time classroom events and procedures. Classroom variables observed over time included interactions of the students with technology, the teachers' classroom management, and instruction between teachers and students. Interobserver reliability between the two researchers on coding was 94%. For this report, we sorted data thematically for examples of P21's Learning and Innovation Skills for creativity, critical thinking, communication, and collaboration. Data triangulation (Patton, 2002) occurred through teacher interviews, classroom observations, and electronic learning environment analysis. Teacher feedback and student survey information further supplemented the triangulation process (Patton, 2002).</p><a id="AN0103382681-9" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_31" title="Mr. Wallen&#39;s Example">Mr. Wallen's Example</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Mr. Wallen, a longtime gamer himself, received training on gamification platforms through his own initiative.

Boot camp empowered students to navigate in online settings, including iPad tips and tricks, setting up online file storage, and use of various applications. He gamified his classroom through3D GameLab, a quest-based learning platform where students earn XPs, badges, and awards competing against themselves to progress through hierarchical tasks.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The paid 3D GameLab platform simplifies the teacher management of quests and tracking student progress; however, gaming mechanics can be incorporated into any existing learning management system, including free open-s ource learning platforms such as Moodle (https://moodle.org). Figure 1 depicts a student's view of the 3D GameLab homepage, including gaming mechanics.</p><a id="AN0103382681-11" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_36" title="Designing Curriculum">Designing Curriculum</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Mr. Wallen first transformed his existing science curriculum into "quest chains," or roadmaps for instruction. Within the quest chain, students had options for reaching leveled XP requirements and could select quests of interest, rather than completing assignments in a fixed, linear progression (see Figure 2). They had to earn the required amount of XPs before "leveling up." Quest chains increased in difficulty in terms of concepts the students were learning, providing a measured approach to build knowledge at a gradual pace (Gee, 2003). Through gamification and technology, students could self-regulate their learning (Abrams &amp; Walsh, 2014). Students picked what activities to complete based on skill, knowledge, interest, and time. Therefore, his students were in control of their learning choices. A student's survey response illustrates this: "In GameLab, I get to decide which lessons I want to do. In my other classes, I have to go by the teacher's schedule."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The progression of quests began with a big idea, such as the principle that matter cannot be created or destroyed. Using the backward design principle (Wiggins &amp; McTighe, 2005), Mr. Wallen provided his students with a bigger picture or template statement to help his learners make sense of details within the quest. Next, students were exposed to a variety of multimedia. For example, students could view short video clips, either found online, such as "States of Matter" on BrainPOP (https://<a href="http://www.brainpop.com/">www.brainpop.com</a>) or Bill Nye's "Phases of Matter" hosted on YouTube, or through teacher-developed videos, such as Mr. Wallen 's presentation on linear measurement (https://iu.app.box .com/linearmeasurement). The goal of interacting with a variety of texts was to front-load science concepts and build schemata within the matter unit.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As students progressed through the quest levels, they earned awards or badges. Badges, by design, used science vocabulary to reinforce key concepts and build a deep understanding of related terms. As shown in Figure 3) students began the quest as a solid and evolved through the states of matter as they leveled up through the curriculum. Their goal was to reach the highest level, sublimation. The game itself was associated with the unit's vocabulary words, rather than isolated definitions, and students were able to attach words to real-world contexts (see Figure 3).</p><a id="AN0103382681-12" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_40" title="Assessment and Mastery Learning">Assessment and Mastery Learning</a></span><p xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">~~~~~~~~</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">By Mr. Wallen 's design, instruction through gamification offered a low-shreat experience. Failure in the instructional environment had a low cost and provided an opportunity for additional practice (Gee, 2013). In Mr. Wallen's classroom, students were given opportunities to repeat content, complete alternate assignments, or request additional time before passing quests, allowing students to demonstrate mastery learning of the topic. Included in the quest chain were frequent formative assessments, called "mini bosses." These were preparation for beating "the boss," better known as a final assessment. Progress bars within 3D GameLab were visible to the student and used to document growth toward the final unit goals. For Mr. Wallen, the game elements were important because they took advantage of the motivation that video games offer to promote mastery learning. "They want, just like any video game, to achieve the highest score. They want one hundred percent, and if that means getting a perfect score on a second or a third try, they learned it" (personal communication, May 7, 2014).</p><a id="AN0103382681-13" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_42" title="Observations of Mr. Wallen&#39;s Classroom">Observations of Mr. Wallen's Classroom</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We used our theoretical framework aligned to new initiatives to organize our observations into the following P21 Learning and Innovation Skills: (a) creativity and innovation, (b) critical thinking and problem solving, and (c) communication and collaboration.

Creative thinking includes a wide range of cognitive skills to pattern knowledge in new, innovative ways (L.W. Anderson, 2009).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Colette worked with a group of students to complete the quest "Act It Out." Their job was to create an iMovie to document a change in matter, acting like molecules. They gathered outside of their classroom, iPad mounted on a tripod, writing their script within a storyboard. According to task requirements, their collaborative final product included an informative narration and video effects and was published within the learning management system.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The quest activities required the use of multiliteracies skills and knowledge, including linguistic, auditory, spatial, visual, and gestural, to create a participatory culture for students (New London Group, 2000). Specifically, students were required to brainstorm ideas, craft a script, and perform, all while implementing new literacies skills to navigate iMovie, synthesize and edit content, and publish a final product online. Students engaged in creative and innovative thinking when completing the quest while paying attention to what was appropriate for the given audience. The literacy skills involved in the quest were extensive, allowing students to think creatively and work creatively with others to showcase knowledge of a topic in an innovative way. Mr. Wallen's students became multimodal designers of content through this technology-rich quest (Dalton, 2013).</p><a id="AN0103382681-15" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_48" title="Critical Thinking and Problem Solving">Critical Thinking and Problem Solving</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The push for critical thinking traces back to Dewey's (1910) time, when value laid in knowing what to do with acquired information rather than simply repeating facts for a test. Gee (2013) illustrated the connection between games and critical thinking, stating that games are "just well-designed experiences in problem solving" (p. 19). To problem solve quests, Colette and her peers must think like a scientist by implementing disciplinary-specific strategies, one of the major literacy shifts in the Common Core. Proficient science readers must know how to read text, often including tables and charts, focusing specifically on text features to support interpretation (Krajcik &amp; Sutherland, 2010).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Take, for example, Mr. Wallen's "Super Block" quest in which students measure the mass, volume, and density of various metals (e.g., gold, silver, copper). Students first explore quest-embedded hyperlinks to read about density control before generating a hypothesis, evaluating data, and drawing conclusions. Students assimilate learned information in new contexts to reflect on the following question: "If you were a superhero, what could you do with the power to change your density, either to make yourself more dense or less dense?"</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">When she did this quest, Colette, like field scientists, had to consider multiple sources of data to generate connections, build arguments, and support claims. The quest required her to synthesize and compile information in new ways to propose a solution for her fictitious superhero. Her thinking needed to be systematic and include deductive and inductive reasoning for critical thinking and problem solving (P21, 2009b).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Mr. Wallen designed this quest experience within multiple learning modalities, including digital, print, and other multimodal formats. Responses were crafted using new literacies skills within digital contexts that required "new forms of strategic knowledge" (Leu et al., 2013, p. 1162). Students uploaded screenshots of their responses or typed out their conclusion within a collaborative writing platform. Part of the task was to view other students' work without duplicating previous student responses, thus adding an additional level of critical thinking to create new expressions of information. A sample of student responses can be found in Figure 4.</p><a id="AN0103382681-16" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_53" title="Communication and Collaboration">Communication and Collaboration</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Gamification of curriculum affords students opportunities to use technology to communicate and collaborate within both traditional and online environments. Transforming a traditional science activity into a gaming quest allows technology to foster the collaboration process. Indeed, gaming in itself is a collaborative undertaking (Gee, 2013), and the Common Core's Anchor Standards include participation in conversations and collaborations with diverse partners, purposeful presentation of information, and use of digital media to express information and enhance presentations (NGA Center &amp; CCSSO, 2010).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Colette joined a triad to create a tutorial video for the quest "Teach Me How to Measure." Her group 's chosen topic was measuring volume. In this quest, the task was to teach others how to measure liquid volume using a graduated cylinder by creating a tutorial video with an interactive whiteboard application. The purpose of the tutorial creation was to share knowledge with a larger audience. Specifically, the group video was to be used by Mr. Wallen 's colleague, who, in future weeks, would be teaching this concept to her class.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The use of online communication technologies can motivate students to write for a larger audience, provide meaningful exchanges, and help students develop social identities (Kuteeva, 2011; Lewis &amp; Fabos, 2005). Creating and collaborating for others can shift writing away from a grade-based task. It becomes situated within a social context with an increased focus on style, genre, and audience (Sweeny, 2010).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Within the gamified unit, Colette worked together with her peers to develop an iMovie, discussed concepts within a lab, created tutorials, and shared new knowledge within collaborative writing platforms. Colette and her partners engaged with science content while providing scaffolded instruction to others in digital literacy skills, sharing tips and demonstrating technology applications. Learning became situated within an affinity space (Gee, 2004) to provide increased opportunities to pursue interests and collaborate on projects. Embedding collaborative tasks was a central aspect of Mr. Wallen's quest design.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It used to be the whole class was doing the lab together at the same time, or the whole class would be doing an activity where they're partnered up. It seems like the quest collaboration now is more genuine. It's individuals coming together to do an assignment. It' s more purposeful and real. (personal communication, May 7,2014)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Quests can promote meaningful conversations with students, as they use literacy skills to discuss and problem solve quest activities, all while focusing on 21st-century student outcomes.

Students (N = 47) reported that they looked forward to days when they used iPads for 3D GameLab, with 95.8% marking agree or strongly agree. This demonstrates an overall enjoyment of this teaching method. Students stated that using the technology made learning easier (87.2%), and the quality of their work was better when learning through the gamification tool (87.2%). Subject matter is easier to learn in 3D GameLab according to 82.9% of the students, and 91.5% reported 3D GameLab as being better for learning than paper-and-pencil tasks. Most students (93.6%) stated that they enjoyed earning gaming badges. These findings have implications for instruction as well as motivation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Students were asked about the activities in which they use technology outside of school. The top responses included looking up information for own interest (58.5%), role-playing and virtual games (48.8%), and looking up information for school (43%). The activity that was most commonly reported for within-school technology use was looking up information for school (89.5%).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Open-ended, qualitative questions were asked to gain a broader understanding of students' perspectives. In a frequency count for the responses (N = 47), the five most common descriptions for gamification activities were fun (n = 22), easy (n = 8), exciting (n = 7), favorite (n = 6), and free choice (n = 10). Students identified that 3D GameLab learning, when compared with other types of instruction, was less boring (n = 11). They enjoyed the games/quests (n = 16) and the pace (n = 30) of learning. A student commented, "GameLab gives you options of what to do and how to do it. Most other classes go in one straight line. GameLab is more like a web. You do different things but end up with the same results."

To ensure meaningful approaches for technological practices, there is a need to align instruction to the ethos of new literacies. Not only is literacy situated within social contexts (Gee, 2001), but digital tools afford new and increased opportunities for social interaction and collaboration, therefore providing authentic opportunities within multiple modalities. New modes and multimedia are reshaping how learners communicate (Kress, 2003). The kinds of learning that take place through well-designed games -- and, through extension, gamification -- provide an environment that negotiates text and images, pulling together the principles of New Literacies theory (Gee, 2007).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Building on research about engagement and achievement (Fredricks, Blumenfeld, &amp; Paris, 2004; Griffiths, Sharkey, &amp; Furlong, 2009), future research may explore the specific impact of gamification on student literacy performance. This is one case study. Research in gamification would benefit from more controlled, experimental studies within adolescent classrooms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Future predictions for 2025 compare Internet sharing with the flow of electricity, meaning invisible and interwoven into daily life (Anderson &amp; Rainie, 2014). Currently, there is a disconnect between the ways students use the Internet at home versus school (Project Tomorrow, 2011). This can create roadblocks, leaving Internet-savvy students frustrated and discouraged with both the quality of access and the inability of schools to use technology in meaningful ways. New literacies can be a means to overcome these roadblocks.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although the majority of students worldwide use the Internet for online gaming (OECD, 2011), teachers often characterize gaming as disreputable and violent, seeing little to no potential for use in school contexts (Shaffer, Squire, Halverson, &amp; Gee, 2005). GBL can shorten this disconnect by bridging the types of activities students favor at home (gaming) with the required, standards-based curriculum -- as one student put simply, "A fun way to learn, but it does not feel like learning."</p><a id="AN0103382681-19" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_69" title="More to Explore">More to Explore</a></span><a id="AN0103382681-20" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><h4 xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> CONNECTED CONTENT-BASED RESOURCES  </h4><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">✓ Utilize free resources for creating badges, such as Mozilla Open Badges (openbadges.org) or Edmodo (https://<a href="http://www.edmodo.com/">www.edmodo.com</a>).

Explore apps, games, and available online tools that can be integrated into quests. Categorize these resources according to P21's Learning and Innovation skills.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal">3. Consider opportunities to move students from consumers to producers of information. Work to develop social spaces using Web 2.0 technologies, such as blogs or wikis, to promote 21st-century student outcomes. Allow or create spaces for students to share their compositions with others outside of the classroom.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal">4. Examine concepts within your curriculum that lend themselves to multimodal composition for student groups. Have students share understandings of concepts within multiple modalities to support acquisition of new literacies skills. For example, have students create a podcast, movie trailer, or digital story to put a different spin on a curricular concept, incorporating images, sound effects, and audio narration when appropriate.</span></li></ul><a id="AN0103382681-23" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="ref_toc" title=" References  "> References  </a></span><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em><a id="bib1"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib1up" id="bib_upbib1" title="" data-title=""></a> Abrams, S.S., &amp; Walsh, S.

One way to improve serious game design could be to introduce surprising events linked to the instructional material. We modified our serious game for triage training, called Code Red Triage, to include three surprising events pertaining to decision-making moments in the triage procedure. Forty-one participants were divided into two groups: one group played a version of the game with the surprising events, and the other group played a control version of the game. A pre-posttest design showed no significant difference in engagement and surface learning, but did show the participants in the surprising events condition obtained significantly superior knowledge structures, indicating that surprising events in a serious game foster deeper learning.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Nowadays, serious gaming and its merits over traditional teaching needs little introduction (cf. Prensky, 2007). However, so far only little corroborating evidence has been found of the improved efficacy of stand-alone serious games over traditional instruction when it comes to learning a certain task; something that is further hindered by a lack of systematic empirical research into what constitutes good serious game design (Van der Spek, Wouters &amp; Van Oostendorp, 2011).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Learning from serious games is more complex than from other more traditional forms of education; on top of the instructional content they also addmultimodal information that makes it more engaging and gives it character; players additionally need to spatially navigate (3D) virtual environments and furthermore perform actions based on their own understanding of the game's goals and rules. However, games also have something that most other instructional forms lack, which could potentially be used to improve learning efficacy.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Most games are not like other learning environments in that they are simply a multimodal interactive representation of information with some formof feedback; they are more experiential in nature. The player takes on the role of a character in the game and experiences a narrative created by the game designer, either implied by the progression of obstacles and environments a player faces in a spatial narrative, or in the more traditional sense of storylines or plots (cf. Jenkins, 2004). Narrative events are known to be able to enhance learning in a number of different ways.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Hoeken and Van Vliet (2000) identified a number of different story techniques that can be used to enhance comprehension of a text: suspense, curiosity and surprise. Of these, the surprising event proved to be the most effective; it improved comprehension of the text as well as increasing appreciation for the story. For a way in which curiosity can be fostered in a serious game, potentially benefiting learning, see Wouters, Van Oostendorp, Boonekamp and Van der Spek (2011).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Introducing surprising events to improve learning</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Experiments in text processing done by Zwaan, Langston and Graesser (1995) have shown that a reader comprehends a narrative by constructing a situation model--a reader's mental model of the story in terms of the protagonist, time, space, causality and intentionality, which is updated on one or more of these dimensions whenever an event takes place.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">When a person plays a game, he or she will have to create a situation model of the events and underlying rules of the game in order to understand it. If this initial situation or mental model turns out to be inadequate in light of new information, the new corrective information will not necessarily lead to a significant update of the mental model; learners are known to cling to previous preconceptions almost to a fault (De Jong &amp; Van Joolingen, 1998; Van Oostendorp &amp; Bonebakker, 1999).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The underlying assumption of why surprising events may improve comprehension of a story is that a surprising event creates uncertainty, which will heighten a person's cognitive interest (Campion, Martins &amp; Wilhelm, 2009; Kintsch, 1980) and could also enhance engagement (Howard-Jones &amp; Demetriou, 2009). In addition, if information presented with this event contrasts previous information, the player has to reevaluate his or her preconceptions and determine if they have missed something (Kintsch, 1980). This reevaluation in turn forces a retrieval (or activation) and update of a preexisting mental or situation model (Zwaan et al, 1995). Therefore, a surprising event heightens cognitive interest and could stimulate better knowledge integration. From a neurological standpoint, a novel stimulus such as a surprising event will lead to a higher activation of a number of brain areas, releasing neuromodulators and noradrenaline, which subsequently results in more attention to the stimulus and better memory formation than with a familiar stimulus (Ranganath &amp; Rainer, 2003).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Graesser, Chipman, Leeming and Biedenbach (2009) noted that complex learning and enjoyment are often at odds with each other, where, in line with the popular proverb "no pain no gain," students that were required to engage in deep learning reported lower enjoyment. Deep learning here is the cognitive process in which the learner actively tries to make sense of new information, as opposed to surface learning, where the learner only memorizes information for reproducing (Chin &amp; Brown, 2000). During this active knowledge construction, the learner builds a mental representation of the instructional material by using prior knowledge extensively (Moreno &amp; Mayer, 2007). This concept of a mental representation or mental model is closely related to the situation model of Zwaan et al (1995), and thereforewe hypothesize that a surprising event forces an update of the situation model and subsequently leads to improved deep learning (Graesser et al, 2009).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">If introducing surprising events can lead to a higher appreciation of a game, more engagement, heighten cognitive interest and improves the integration of new information with prior knowledge into a coherent knowledge structure, then this game adaptation may mitigate the ostensible tradeoff between engagement and deep learning.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The hypotheses we subsequently tested with this experiment were that implementing surprising events in a serious game: (1) improves learning, possibly, (2) deep learning (ie, improved knowledge structures) and (3) leads to a higher enjoyment and/or engagement of the game.</p><a id="AN0084482714-3" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_16" title="Surprising events in triage training">Surprising events in triage training</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To test whether introducing surprising events in a serious game can improve learning and engagement in a serious game (as well as other hypotheses, cf. Van der Spek et al, 2011), we created a 3D triage training game called Code Red Triage. The game is a First Person total modification of Half Life 2: Episode Two (2009), where the player role-plays a medical first responder at the scene of a mass casualty event. The player arrives at a train station and receives an incoming call of a terrorist strike on a subway platform, with first reports indicating between 10 and 30 victims (in actuality there are 19). The player then has to find the way to the subway platform and upon arriving there categorize all the victims according to the urgency with which medical attention should be provided, so that when the other ambulance crews arrive, the most heavily injured victims will be treated first.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This is the full extent of the "plot"; Code Red Triage operates a light narrative, which is mostly in the form of environmental storytelling (Jenkins, 2004). The player experiences a progression from a bright train station with minor traces of panic, through winding corridors to a moodily lighted subway platformwith increasing signs of carnage that is built to evoke the feeling of what a player would expect the aftermath of a terrorist strike to look like. In addition, the succession of victim cases the player has to categorize could also be seen as a narrative of sorts.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The procedure withwhich the victims are categorized is called a triage; in our version of the game we teach the mobility sieve triage procedure (Hodgetts, 2003). Here, the medical first responder should roughly perform the following checks: determine whether the victim is still mobile, whether the airway is obstructed, measure the breathing frequency and the blood circulation. According to the outcome of these checks the victim should be categorized in one of four categories: highly urgent (T1), moderately urgent (T2), non-urgent (T3) and dead. For our experiment, it is also important to know that if the airway is obstructed it needs to be freed by either a chin lift in normal conditions, or a jaw thrust if the victim has a neck trauma. In addition, the blood circulation is ideally gauged with the capillary refill time check, but this is only applicable if there is enough light; in darkness, the player should check the pulse rate of the victim. The procedure has been slightly simplified from the real one in order to keep it learnable for laymen in a short time period.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Beforehand the player will only be told about the four different triage categories; the procedure with which to arrive at one of the four categories is for the player to find out by playing the game. When the player arrives at the subway platform he will encounter the nineteen victims walking, standing, sitting or lying down in a roughly sequential manner. Pressing the e-button while standing in front of a victim will open up the triage menu screen (see Figure 1). Here, the player can choose from a number of options, such as check the airway or perform the chin lift; pressing the corresponding button will give information on what the option entails in the triage situation and what this means for the current victim. For example, "You determine whether the airway is free and the victim is able to breathe freely, if the airway is obstructed, it needs to be freed./You do not have to check the airway of this victim, because the victim is still able to walk."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">After the player has appraised the severity of the injuries, he can choose one of the four different categories. He will be awarded a score for how well he performed the triage, based on whether he clicked the correct buttons, whether this was done in the right order, the correct triage category was chosen and in what time frame. Briefly after triaging the victim, he sees how well he performed expressed in text, and the score is added to the total score at the top of the screen (see Figure 2). The players ultimately have to discern the correct procedure by the information given by the button presses and the feedback presented to them after every triage. Previous experiments have shown that the score is a relevant measure for performance of the triage (Van der Spek et al, 2011).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">After careful consideration of the game and the triage procedure, we decided that the decision moments most suitable to be preceded by a surprising event, were (1) the mobility check, where being mobile means the victim is lightly injured, (2) the choice between a chin lift without neck trauma or a jaw thrust when the victim does have a neck trauma, and (3) the choice between the capillary refill test and measuring the pulse rate based on lighting conditions. The latter two were moments in which information introduced after the surprising event to some extent contrasted the previous notions of the player. For example, in the case of the neck trauma event the player had been using the chin lift, but needed to switch to the jawthrust, as using a chin lift on a patient with a neck traumawould lead to serious injuries. In the case of the mobility check, the surprising event condition is only surprising in the sense that it is unexpected, potentially creating uncertainty and heightened cognitive interest, but as the mobility check is the first thing the player learns, it does not contradict previous information. The surprising events will be explained further in the Experimental conditions section.</p><a id="AN0084482714-4" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_23" title="Method">Method</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Participants</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In total 41 persons participated in the experiment, but two participants did not answer all of the postgame questions, resulting in a different valid N for that test. The participants were all university students following a masters-level game design course; participation in the experiment was a compulsory prerequisite to pass the exam, but the students were told beforehand that they would receive a coupon worth ë7.50, in order to counterbalance this possible demotivation effect.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The average age of the participants was 23.3 (SD = 1.89), with 36 male and 5 female that were randomly assigned to either of the two conditions. Two women were in the control condition, three in the experimental condition. As the participants were students enrolled in a game design course, most of them had an interest in gaming. Out of 41, 2 hardly played video games, 21 occasionally played games and 18 would label themselves as "a gamer."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Experimental conditions</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In order to test the hypothesis whether surprising events can foster learning, we created a condition with three surprising events, pertaining to three different choices/steps in the triage procedure. These steps, aswell as the corresponding events, are furthermore unrelated to each other, so as to prevent any interaction effects. This Surprising Event (SE) condition is then contrasted to a control condition, which does not have these surprising events.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Both conditions of the game are based on a version of the game where the instruction is built up in such a way that the game started off easy and gradually became more difficult. In practice, this meant that the player began with only two buttons, or steps in the procedure, to choose from for the first victim: a mobility check and investigating the airway. From one victim to the next, buttons were gradually added until the thirteenth victim, when all eight buttons were available for the remaining six victims (see Figure 1). A similar buildup of difficulty was present in the victim cases, where the first few victims only required a mobility check to determine that they were lightly injured, but subsequent victims progressively required more procedural steps to arrive at a triage decision.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The three surprising events are a mobility event, a neck trauma event and a light failure event. All surprising events are in the form of a short in-game cut scene of two to four seconds and occur only once before a new concept is taught. See Figure 3 for a timeline of screenshots of the different events.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Mobility event</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The mobility event took place during the first encounter with a victim, in the hallway before the player went down the stairs toward the subway platform. In the SE condition, the victim ran toward the player screaming and cowered down in front of him. In the control condition, the victim walked around in circles at a leisurely pace. The purpose of the first few victims was to teach that if a victim is able to walk, then that victim is lightly injured according to the triage procedure.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The SE condition is more eventful; it adds sound, the player experiences a cut scene for the first time, and the victim running toward the player adds immediacy. There are a total of five consecutive victims that are lightly injured, for which only the mobility has to be checked. The mobility event was considered surprising as something salient happened suddenly and unexpectedly. As it happened with the first victim a player encounters, the subsequent information to be learned did not necessarily contradict previously learned information. This event was still included in order to check if heightened cognitive interest through a surprising event alone led to better learning.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Neck trauma event</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the neck trauma event in the SE condition, the 13th victim in the game is standing upright, with its back turned toward the player. The moment the player approached the victim, the cut scene started. Here, the camera starts shaking and a rumbling sound is played. A large piece of ceiling debris came crumbling down and fell on the victim's head, which produced a startled scream before collapsing to the ground. After this surprising event, the text in the triage screen noted that the victim may have a neck trauma, which in turn meant that the player should perform a jaw thrust instead of a chin lift. In the control condition, the victim was already lying down on the floor unconscious, with the suspicion of a neck trauma introduced by the text in the same way as in the SE condition. There are two consecutive victims that suffer neck trauma.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Light failure event</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The final notion that we wanted to be preceded by a surprising event was that the capillary refill check is preferable unless there is insufficient lighting, in which case the player has to check the pulse rate. As is noticeable from Figure 3, the subway platform area of the game looked different in the two conditions of the game. In the control condition, the emergency lighting was turned on, presumably (to the player) because the blast impact caused a power outage. At the outset all the victims were bathed in enough red light to perform a capillary refill check, but the last few victims were placed in shadows, blocking the possibility to check their blood circulation with the capillary refill time. In the SE condition the normal incandescent lighting was still on upon reaching the platform. Right before reaching the 14th victim the surprising event occurred: a cut scene of an explosion in a power box leading to a temporary blackout. Two seconds later the emergency lights jittered on, accompanied by a loud mechanical whizzing sound. After this, in both conditions the playerwas notified that itwas too dark to performa capillary refill check. Four victims needed their pulse rate checked.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Materials</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In order to test our hypotheses that surprising events in games foster learning and engagement, we used a number of different instruments. As was mentioned earlier, the game records how well the player performs the triage procedure while playing the game. While this in-game score may not give an accurate depiction of how well the player is learning--triaging a victim incorrectly leads to a lower score but may still give the player insight into the procedure, it does tell uswhether the experimental intervention leads to the player exhibiting desired playing behavior ie, play the game as it is meant to be played.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To measure how well participants have learned the triage procedure, we used a pre-posttest design with a knowledge test. The 16 questions on this test were divided into eight verbal questions and eight pictorial questions, where rendered mock-ups of victims are shown together with a short description, and the participant then has to choose the next step in the triage procedure, which is more in line with the game. These questionswere all four-itemmultiple-choice questions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The eight questions in either the verbal and pictorial part of the knowledge test consisted of three questions that were related to the three surprising events. Here, the participant was presented with a victim case with certain injuries and had to decide upon the next step in the triage procedure. Because they were in the form of case resolutions and did not ask about the material pertaining to the surprising event outright, we named these indirect questions. The remaining five questions were about other, unrelated parts of the procedure. We called these "unrelated" questions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition to these 16 questions, we added five direct questions (one for mobility event, two for neck trauma and lighting event) asking outright eg, "if it is dark and youwant to check a victim's blood circulation, then according to the procedure of the primary triage you should use", again with four possible answers.We only asked these questions post intervention, aswe felt theywould guide the participant into attending the related instruction if they had come up in a pretest knowledge test.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Summarizing, there were six (three verbal and three pictorial) indirect questions of the instructional material pertaining to the surprising events, five direct questions and ten questions unrelated to the surprising events.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition to gauging the effect of surprising events in a game narrative on a surface or declarative level, we were also interested in the effect on a deeper level of understanding ("deep learning"). In order to test this, Trumpower, Sharara and Goldsmith (2010) among others propose a structural assessment of knowledge, where, in our case, participants rate pairs of concepts pertaining to the triage procedure on their degree of relatedness. The software program Path-finder 6.3 can then be used to construct distance networks called PFnets from this data, which in turn can be averaged and used to compare groups of participants with a reference expert network (cf. Schvaneveldt, Durso &amp; Dearholt, 1985). This Structural Knowledge Assessment (SKA) technique is able to distinguish between experts and novices and to predict transfer performance on decision-making tasks (Day, Arthur &amp; Gettman, 2001), which is of key importance to assessing training games such as ours. Furthermore, we have found it was able to discern the effects of game design on knowledge construction in a previous experiment with our game (Van der Spek, Van Oostendorp, Wouters &amp; Aarnoudse, 2010).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">An example of the resultant network with the concepts that had to be rated can be seen in Figure 4. As the participants had to rate each combination of pairs, the number of possible combinations and thereby ratings grows quickly with each new concept added. Therefore, we only chose a subset of the triage procedure that incorporates the information pertaining to the surprising events. The network in Figure 4 was derived from averaging the PFnets of two experts in the triage procedure, and serves as the referent network against which the participants are compared. Concepts that are closely related have direct links, while less related concepts are placed further away in the network, via intermediate links. We find that, grosso modo, novices have more diffuse networks, whereas the expert has a cleaner network with "classify victim" as the central node, linked to the main steps in the triage procedure and a cluster comprising chin lift, jaw thrust and blocked airway with neck trauma.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The last test we used was for measuring the subjective emotional response to the game. We asked the participants to rate how difficult they found the game and how much they enjoyed the game, on a score of 1 to 10. In addition, we used the engagement subset of the Independent Television Commission's Sense of Presence Inventory (ITC-SOPI; Lessiter, Freeman, Keogh &amp; Davidoff, 2001). By this time the participant is subjected to quite a number of tests, so we used only this subset, as it gives a mix of presence and engagement through a 12-item Likert scale.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Procedure and apparatus</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The participants were sat behind a desk with a 17" wide-screen laptop computer, which was closed off from the rest of the room by a cubicle partitioning wall. They first filled in a small demographics questionnaire and were then presented the different tests in the order as can be seen in Figure 5.</p><a id="AN0084482714-5" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_49" title="Results">Results</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Table 1 shows the percentages of correct answers on the different paper knowledge tests: indirect questions pertaining to the surprising events, direct questions pertaining to the surprising events, the aggregate average of these questions and finally the scores on the questions unrelated to the surprising events.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Multiple MANCOVAs were performed with direct and indirect posttest questions as multiple dependent variables, corresponding indirect pretest score as covariate and condition as fixed factor. No significant effects of condition were reached for either the questions pertaining to mobility (Wilks λ = 0.96, F &lt; 1), pertaining to the chin lift/jawthrust distinction (Wilks λ = 0.97, F &lt; 1) and the blood circulation (Wilks λ = 0.90, F(2,37) = 2.0, p = 0.21), although the latter does show a trend for the direct questions: F(1,38) = 3.45, p = 0.07, multivariate η² is 1 minus λ = 0.10). The aggregate scores, as well as the unrelated questions also showed no significant (p &gt; 0.05) effect of condition as factor (ANCOVA F &lt; 1).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Note that, even though none of the results are significant, the participants in the experimental condition with the surprising events have almost consistently scored higher for all of the different tests.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Table 2 shows the means and standard deviations for the SKA, after one posttest outlier (&gt;3 times standard deviation from the mean) was deleted from the control group. An ANCOVA on the SKA test, with SKA posttest as the dependent variable, SKA pretest as covariate and condition as fixed factor shows a significant difference for condition F(1,37) = 5.47, p &lt; 0.05, η² = 0.12. Figure 6 shows a bar chart of the difference in means and standard deviations.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Table 3 shows the results for the in-game score, subjective difficulty rating, subjective enjoyment rating and the ITC-SOPI mean. Overall the SE condition seemed to score a little bit better during the game, but none of these statistics were significant, F(1,39) &lt; 1 for all of the ANOVAs and the reliability of the ITC-SOPI scale was poor with Cronbach coefficient α = 0.53. Individually, the Engagement subquestion "I can vividly remember parts of the experience" seems to indicate a trend in favor of the surprising events condition (F(1,39) = 3.55, p = 0.07, d = 0.59).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">If we take a deeper look at the in-game score, and investigate the score for the triage of the first two victims immediately after the surprising event occurs (the first victim to "learn" how the event changes the game rules, and the second to apply this new knowledge), as a measure of immediate understanding of the game rules, thenwe see the same trend.The participants in the SE condition scored higher on average than those of the control condition after every event; however, this is not significant, F(1,39) &lt; 1.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Finally, we include a number of correlations that arise from the data. The self-reported scale where participants had to rate how much of a gamer they see themselves is positively correlated with the posttest pictorial knowledge test (r(39) = 0.37, p &lt; 0.05), but not the verbal test, possibly indicating a relationship between aptness in processing visual information and playing games, or willingness to play games.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the SE condition, the SKA posttest is positively correlated with the in-game score (r(19) = 0.47, p &lt; 0.05) and with the ITC-SOPI engagement score (r(19) = 0.45, p &lt; 0.05); however, the engagement and in-game score are uncorrelated. None of these scores are significantly correlated in the control condition. As the SKA scores are higher in the SE condition, this means that knowledge construction is integral to a good in-game score and the feeling of being drawn into a game world, but only at a sufficient level of understanding.</p><a id="AN0084482714-6" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_58" title="Conclusion and discussion">Conclusion and discussion</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">On learning</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We set out to determine whether surprising events in a game narrative can be used to improve learning. Our experiment has shown that a relatively easy adaptation to an existing serious game can already stimulate deeper learning, without harming the engaging characteristics of the game. The surprising events improved the way the newfound knowledge is integrated into the player's mental model, as was evidenced by a structural knowledge assessment. Therefore, introducing surprising events is a good way of increasing the effectiveness of a serious game.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Curiously, the surprising events did not lead to better scores on the paper knowledge tests. On face value, this simply implies that a change in the game narrative only stimulates deeper knowledge organization, and not more superficial (verbal) knowledge acquisition. A possible explanation for this may be that the narrative is interpreted on a structural level, and any changes therein will therefore lead to a comprehension that differs on a structural level as well. As there was no difference on the paper knowledge test scores, it is impossible to distinguish between the mobility event and the other two events, and therefore to satisfactorily determine whether the improvement in learning was due to the surprising events solely causing a heightened cognitive interest, or also a better handling of ostensibly contradictory information (and thereby better knowledge integration). However, given that the results show improved deeper learning, which is linked to the better integration of new conflicting information into prior knowledge structures (Kintsch, 1980), we contend that the latter explanation is the more plausible one. For the correct generalization of our findings we should make a few provisos though.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">When looking at the results of the paper knowledge tests in more detail, the hundred percent correctness of the direct questions on the capillary refill time and pulse rate distinction in the SE condition is remarkable, but because the control condition scored highly on this question as well, the difference was not significant. It may well be that the control condition of the game already was too successful as a teaching material to notice a significant difference, and that introducing surprising events may benefit other serious games even on a knowledge acquisition level. This notion is repudiated by the fact that no difference in in-game score was found directly after an event, although we already argued that the in-game score is a weak indicator for actual learning. It does, however, bring us to another possible threat to the validity.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our game lasted around 20 minutes; it may also be that three surprising events of a few seconds is too small an intervention to induce more substantial knowledge acquisition effects. In addition, we also did not test for knowledge retention over longer periods.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Another interesting avenue for future research comes from neuropsychology, which shows that inducing stress or arousal in a person after (instead of before) something has been learned, leads to better recall (cf. McGaugh, 2006). Already many entertainment games first teach a player a new technique in a relatively quiet part of the game, and then have the player use this in a stressful situation such as a boss fight. If this was found to improve learning, it could be worthwhile to discern how much of this change can be attributed to practicing the new skill, or due to increased arousal levels.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">On engagement</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">There was no significant difference in engagement and subjective difficulty and enjoyment between the two conditions of the game. One can therefore say that introducing a few surprising events does not improve the engagement of a serious game. We did find a positive correlation between scores on the structural knowledge assessment and engagement ratings in the surprising events condition, which may indicate that the introduction of surprising events circumvents the "no pain no gain" problem of deep learning and engagement. However, the same provisions concerning the time of the instruction and the number and nature of the events apply to the subjective enjoyment of the game as well. In addition, here too a number of remarks can be made on the validity of this finding.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Firstly, the participants only saw one version of the game and therefore had to rate the engaging qualities without being able to compare the two versions. For most participants it furthermore was their first real encounter with a serious training game of this type. The problem is that without a clear referent, it becomes unclearwhat the participant's prior expectations are. It could be that both groups would have preferred the version with surprising events, but the control group did not expect them in the first place.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Conversely, it could also be that a serious game that has a stimulating narrative is more fun in direct comparison with a condition without surprising events, but that this raises the expectations of the player to that of entertainment games,which is a hurdle too high for many financially challenged serious games developers. This is a question that needs to be answered with more longitudinal research where participants get to experience multiple serious games.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A final remark concerns the use of Likert scale tests with laymen. All participants were students in computer and information science, and as such had little experience with experimental testing and Likert scales. This may, to some extent and together with the lack of referent material for the serious game condition, explain why the reliability of the scale was markedly lower than would be expected. In addition, although the participants were encouraged to be as "painfully honest as possible," most refrained from using the extreme ends of the rating scale. With a 5-point scale, that leaves little discriminative power. One person in the experiment actually physically jumped the moment the lights in the game went out with an explosion. Afterwards he rated "I can vividly remember parts of the experience" and "I experienced emotions while playing" with a neutral score (3), which may well be a case of Dutch reservedness. As a result of these remarks, we contend that the question pertaining to engagement is not satisfactorily answered by our experiment and needs further research.</p><a id="AN0084482714-7" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_70" title="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This research has been supported by the GATE project, funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO).</p><a id="AN0084482714-8" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_72" title="Practitioner Notes">Practitioner Notes</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">What is already known about this topic</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* (Very little.)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* That serious games often fail to reach their potential.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* That a surprising event can lead to a better comprehension of text.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* But that a narrative background in a virtual learning environment led to worse learning.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">What this paper adds</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* A thorough, single-blind, controlled empirical experiment on the effects of serious game design on different factors of learning and engagement.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* That introducing small surprising events in a serious game leads to improved deep comprehension of the instructional material.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* That this intervention has no ostensible effect on engagement.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Implications for practice and/or policy</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* Surprising events should be introduced in a serious game to improve learning.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* Serious game designers should therefore carefully consider how to embed instruction in the game narrative.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* Research in serious game design isworthwhile (and highly needed) because it can lead to better serious games.</p><a id="AN0084482714-9" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_86" title="Table 1: Means (and standard deviation) of the test scores in percentages">Table 1: Means (and standard deviation) of the test scores in percentages</a></span><pre class="ct" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Legend for Chart:

Filling this gap is one of the main aims of the Games and Learning Alliance (<a href="http://www.galanoe.eu/">http://www.galanoe.eu</a>) European Network of Excellence on Serious Games, which has a focus upon pedagogy-driven SGs. This paper relies on the assumption that the fundamental aspect of SG design consists in the translation of learning goals/ practices into mechanical element of gameplay, serving to an instructional purpose beside that of play and fun. This paper proposes the Learning Mechanics-Game Mechanics (LM-GM) model, which supports SG analysis and design by allowing reflection on the various pedagogical and game elements in an SG. The LM-GM model includes a set of pre-defined game mechanics and pedagogical elements that we have abstracted from literature on game studies and learning theories.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Designers and analysts can exploit these mechanics to draw the LM-GM map for a game, so as to identify and highlight its main pedagogical and entertainment features, and their interrelations. The tool may also be useful for teachers to evaluate the effectiveness of a given game and better understand how to implement it in educational settings. A case study is reported to illustrate the framework's support in determining how gameplay and pedagogy intertwine in an SG. Finally, the paper presents the results of two comparative user tests demonstrating the advantages of the proposed model with respect to a similar state-of-the-art framework.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Serious Games (SGs) are gaining ever more interest as an instructional tool capitalising on the appeal of games and the effectiveness of information and communication technologies (ICTs). Recent ICT advances have led to the implementation of realistic virtual environments and simulations, where players can live compelling adventures while acquiring, practising and verifying knowledge according to various pedagogical paradigms (Bellotti, Berta, De Gloria &amp; Primavera, 2009a). This represents a significant opportunity for 21st-century educators and trainers to enhance their educational toolkit.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, a major challenge lies in translating interest and potential into actual adoption and use. SGs must demonstrate the transfer of learning (to be "serious"), while also remaining engaging and entertaining (to be "games"). The balance between fun and educational measures should be targeted throughout the development starting from the design phase. Yet, despite the digital games' potential in terms of interactivity, immersion and engagement, more work is still required to understand how to better design, administrate and evaluate digital games across different learning contexts and targets (Alvarez &amp; Michaud, 2008; Bellotti, Berta &amp; De Gloria, 2010a; de Freitas &amp; Liarokapis, 2011; Dror, 2008; Ulicsak, 2010;Westera, Nadolski, Hummel &amp; Woperels, 2008). One of the biggest issues with educational games to date is the inadequate integration of educational and game design principles (e.g., Gunter, Kenny &amp; Vick, 2006; Kenny &amp; Gunter, 2007; Kiili &amp; Lainema, 2008; Lim et al, 2013). This is due to various factors including the fundamental fact that digital game designers and educational experts do not usually share a common vocabulary and view of the domain (Gunter et al, 2006). This perspective is also shared by Killi and Lainema (2008), and Lim et al (2013). There is hence a need to improve the theoretical basis behind the design of SGs, considering the underlying pedagogic principles and the contexts of use, which are also key to the success (Bellotti, Berta &amp; De Gloria, 2012a).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The principles of learning and gameplay are different and frequently conflicting, but they can coexist in well-designed SGs (Huynh-Kim-Bang, Labat &amp; Wisdom, 2011). This suggests that high-level pedagogical intents can be translated and implemented through low-level game mechanics. Based on this assumption, our paper introduces the concept of Serious Game Mechanic (SGM) defined as the design decision that concretely realises the transition of a learning practice/goal into a mechanical element of gameplay for the sole purpose of play and fun. SGMs act as the game elements/aspects linking pedagogical practices (represented through learning mechanics) to concrete game mechanics directly related to a player's actions. In this paper, the mechanics of learning refer to the dynamic operation of learning, that we typically model relying on learning theories and pedagogical principles. This encompasses components (such specific objectives, tasks, activities, methods) that make up a learning strategy, instructions or process influenced by the context of learning.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As part of the development and validation of the SGM models, this paper reports on the ongoing findings of game analysis using the Learning Mechanics and Game Mechanics (LM-GM) model, a framework that allows SG mapping that highlights the main learning and game mechanics involved in each game situation, thus supporting the identification and analysis of emerging SGMs. As such, the tool is intended for both designers and teachers to evaluate the effectiveness of a given game and better understand how it can be used within an educational setting. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. The next section discusses existing work/ models such as the game-based learning framework and the Amory's (2007) Game Object Model (GOM). The discussion continues with a section on the conceptual background and the methodology behind the LM-GM model. In order to provide evidence on the potential use of the model as an analytic tool, the following section describes a case study that illustrates the use of LM-GM as a tool to analyse how gameplay and pedagogy intertwine in a game. For further validation, the paper describes the results of a comparative study between the LM-GM model and the GOM. Finally, the conclusion section summarises the results and sketches directions for future research.</p><a id="AN0101622040-3" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_10" title="Related work">Related work</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It can be readily seen from entertainment gaming that certain genres, such as role playing, action, adventure and simulation, share similar interaction models and gameplay dynamics among several different titles. GMs are well understood and established in the context of entertainment games. Sicart (2008) cited a plethora of game mechanics definitions but concluded these were neither precise nor inclusive. Sicart subsequently formalised a systemic structure that provided an ontological distinction between rules and mechanics. The Game Ontology Project provides a wiki-enabled hierarchy of elements of gameplay used by games studies researchers (Zagal &amp; Bruckman, 2008).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Building on top of the topology of gameplay rules defined by Frasca (2003), Djaouti, Alvarez, Jessel, Methe and Molinier (2008) propose videogames classification based on the concept of "Game play Bricks," where the different combinations of the "fundamental elements" seem to match the different rules and goals of videogames. They also identified two different types of game rules: the rules that allow the player to "manipulate" the elements of the game, and, at a higher level, the rules defining the "goal" of the game. Generally, GMs express players' agency in the game world via actions (Järvinen, 2008; Sicart, 2008) and consequently are expressed at a lower level through several manipulation rules. These rules focus on "inter/action" type game mechanics that have little pedagogical value. We thus argue that learning must therefore be defined at a higher level, through goals, rules and other components that have a pedagogical value.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Similarly to games purely for entertainment, SGs also have generic components that are replicated and adapted through different titles. However, SG-specific mechanics have yet to be conclusively identified and described. We argue that this is because of the greater complexity and the less diffusion of SGs with respect to games. SGs are quite varied in terms of features and can potentially offer different kinds of learning experience. It is thus important to understand how different game elements can contribute to an effective facilitation of learning. Ritterfeld, Cody and Vorderer (2009) elaborate on the underlying theories that explain suggested psychological mechanisms elicited through serious gameplay, addressing cognitive, affective and social processes. Bellotti, Berta, De Gloria and Zappi (2008) explored the embedding of simple 2D microGames inside a 3D environment, challenging players to extract in-depth knowledge about some particular items embedded in a reconstructed 3D context. This is part of the sandbox SG design model, which has proved to be particularly effective in the cultural heritage domain (Bellotti, Berta, De Gloria, D'Ursi &amp; Fiore, 2012b).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Kenny and Gunter (2007) explored complex learning goals and argued that learning content within a game could be highly related to (ie, highly immersed in) the game's narrative elements. Existing game-based learning frameworks, such as the Four-Dimensional Framework (de Freitas &amp; Oliver, 2006) and the game-based learning framework (Staalduinen and de Freitas, 2011) attempted to address similar issues by prescribing games to be designed based on the considerations relevant to the traditional learning context. An interest for exploratory learning, problem based learning and inquiry learning has been noted in the theory-based pedagogy literature (see extracts from learning theories collected in de Freitas &amp; Jameson, 2012). The Relevance, Embebbing, Transfer, Adaption, Immersion, Naturalisation model assesses how well educational games contain and incorporate academic content and promote transfer of knowledge (Gunter, Kenny &amp; Vick, 2007). The model correlates to three learning theories that are most closely aligned with generally accepted game design principles, namely: Keller's Attention, Relevance, Confidence, Satisfaction (ARCS) Model, Gagne's Events of Instruction and Piaget's ideas on schema. Westera et al (2008) argue that existing frameworks have been effectively used as evaluation guidelines, where game design can be analysed with respect to the educational context. Synthesizing, while the existing practices, frameworks and models in serious games design appear to take serious game mechanics into consideration, they do not specifically target the analysis of the relationships between game mechanics and learning constructs, which is a key factor in game design for learning. There is a need for a framework that is more comprehensive and explicit in terms of how learning components and game components are related to one another. The principles of learning and gameplay, in fact, can be conflicting, and making them effectively coexist is a typical and major challenge of SG design (Huynh-Kim-Bang et al, 2011).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Amory (2007) presented the GOM, a constructivist theoretical framework to support educational games development based around the notion of interrelated components or, in other words, units that have dependencies and relationships with one another. The model comprises five distinct state spaces: Game Space, Visualisation Space, Elements Space, Actor Space and Problem Space. Analogous to object-oriented programming, Amory considers educational games to contain components (objects) that can be described through abstract interfaces (pedagogical/theoretical components) and concrete interfaces (game design components) as shown in Table 1.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although generic and game-genre independent, GOM does not indicate how each unit influences one another nor how situational and contextual factors influence the game's design and the gameplay structure. Its high level operatives mean that GOM does not sufficiently support a description of an SG's learning aspects/goals and their relationships with game components.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We argue that what is really missing from the state of the art is a framework/model for discovering and understanding what game mechanics relate to relevant pedagogical objectives in an SG, which would support more efficient and effective analysis and design of SGs.</p><a id="AN0101622040-4" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_18" title="LM-GM model">LM-GM model</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this paper, we aim to address the identification of the key components (we call them SGMs, see Figure 1) that can be replicated, with the proper differentiations, across different SGs. The goal is to favour an efficient analysis of SGs and support specification of new designs. SGMs reflect the complex relationships between pedagogy, learning and entertainment/fun, joining educational and gaming agendas. Therefore, SGMs are the game components that translate a pedagogical practice/pattern into concrete game mechanics directly perceivable by a player's actions. While game design patterns (e.g., Huynh-Kim-Bang et al, 2011) provide design solutions to common SG issues/requirements, SGMs are finer grain components that can be exploited in several different patterns.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Learning is a very complex human activity, which has been investigated and modelled through several pedagogical theories and approaches, such as behaviourism, cognitivism, humanism, personalism, constructivism, etc. The LM-GM model has been designed to allow different users to describe games on the basis of different pedagogical approaches. In particular, LM-GM's learning mechanics include various aspects (e.g., tasks, activities, goals, relationships) that we have derived from different pedagogical approaches and that an LM-GM user can map to different game mechanics, according to the specific nature of the SGs under analysis.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Formulating LM-GM</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In SGs, gameplay should support intrinsic experiential learning. It is therefore reasonable to postulate that knowledge acquisition and skill training should be obtained through game mechanics (e.g., quests, cascading information, leader boards, goals, levels, badges, role play, tokens, etc) and not, for instance, from related user manuals. Thus, we tried to investigate how to establish relationships between the mechanics present in educational philosophies (pedagogical theories and strategies) and those of games.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We formulated this as the LM-GM model. Figure 2 depicts the components of the model, namely the LMs (represented as nodes in the left side of the picture) and the GMs (represented as nodes in the right side of the picture). The overall framework also includes a detailed description of the meaning of each featured mechanics. The model is descriptive and not prescriptive, in the sense that it allows its users to freely relate learning and gaming mechanics to describe SG situations by drawing a map and filling a table. On the one hand, the table expresses the "static" relationships, inside the SG, between learning and game mechanics, also detailing the actual implementation (as game mechanics are abstract and generic) and usage by the player. An example is provided in Table 3. On the other hand, the map offers a dynamic view of the relationships as it allows drawing the LMs and GMs in the various phases of an SG flow of actions. An example of the resulting map for an SG is provided in Figure3. Overall, the LM-GM model aims at providing a concise means to relate pedagogy intentions and ludic elements within a player's actions and gameplay, ie, SGMs.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The LM nodes illustrated in Figure 2 are a non-exhaustive list of learning mechanics that have been extracted from literature and discussions with educational theorists on 21st century pedagogy, considering a variety of educational theories (e.g., constructivism, behaviourism, personalism), in particular those closer to game education (Brainerd, 1978; Gagné, Briggs &amp; Wagner, 1992; Keller, 1983; Papert &amp; Harel, 1991). In the same manner, the GM nodes were obtained by reviewing papers on game mechanics and dynamics, and they represent the backbone of many game theories (Bellotti, Berta, De Gloria &amp; Primavera, 2009a, b; Connolly, Boyle, Hainey, MacArthur &amp; Boyle, 2012; Järvinen, 2008; Sicart, 2008). Proper combinations of these mechanics may be applied in several SG application domains, from languages to science, humanities and arts.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Given the traits mentioned above, the authors argue that the LM-GM could be used to aid SG analysis (ie, identifying and assessing the main features and components of an SG), design (ie, thinking of what components could constitute a new SG) and specification (ie, specifying the components of an SG and their relationships).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Application</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For simplicity, the reading of the LM-GM model can be viewed as having two axes. On the horizontal axis lie the learning and game mechanics analogous to a breadth-first search. Core components run vertically down from the two root nodes (of learning mechanics and game mechanics respectively) in a manner similar to a depth-first search. Side or leaf nodes represent functional mechanics supporting the core.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">From a pedagogical perspective, one would argue that how a user learns is, in essence, more important than the domain specificity of the medium through which the learning is performed. Based on Bloom's theory (Bloom, 1956), a simplified framework/classification (Table 2) organised in line with the digital taxonomy of Anderson &amp; Krathwohl, (2001) can be used to link commonly found game mechanics to learning mechanism. As an example, this table emphasises upon task-centred learning rather than cognitive learning. Indeed, a game can be seen as a continuous assessment of gained knowledge as the player proceeds from level to level.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">So, a user of the model should identify which LM and GM are (or should be, in case of design) used in each game situation (among the ones listed in Figure 2), describe their relationships and implementation (e.g., Table 3) and show on a map their dynamic appearance during the game flow of actions (e.g., Figure 3).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">By exploring the LM-GM model, the Games and Learning Alliance (GALA) network aims to address the mismatch between game mechanics and educational components at the design and development level. The model enables further questioning as to whether the games should adapt to existing pedagogical practices or whether they should be used to change practices since they form an entity that functions to educate and entertain through a single compelling experience. The impact from the SGMs investigations would draw out larger research themes on the intersections of games and pedagogy (both traditional and new). It will also pave the way for a toolset rather than a black box for designing content-specific SG. It is important to note, though, that the LM-GM framework is not a formulaic means to design SGs. The purpose of the LM-GM is to support working with SGMs by functioning as a regression tool for developers and as analytic tool for those interested in studying the mechanisms joining pedagogical and game features.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Case study: LM-GM as an analysis tool</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this section, we describe a case study aimed at showing how to apply the framework in the analysis of the relationships between pedagogy and game mechanics in a state-of-the-art SG such as Re-Mission (Kato, Cole, Bradlyn &amp; Pollock, 2008).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Re-Mission is a game of the third-person shooter (TPS) genre set within the bodies of young patients diagnosed with cancer, in which the player is tasked with aiding a virtual patient combat the disease and its effects. This game was chosen given its popularity and acknowledged effectiveness in the field and because of the need to understand better whether its game mechanics at their implementation level are inherently pedagogically beneficial. Reported works (Cole, Yoo and Knutson 2012; Kato et al 2008; Mader, Natkin and Levieux 2012; Tate, Haritatos and Cole 2009; Wouters, van Oostendorp, Boonekamp &amp; van der Spek, 2011) on Re-Mission often do not sufficiently specify measures related to productive learning as a result of the game mechanics. Indeed, in several SGs, extraneous (ie, pedagogy independent) game mechanics are often designed to enhance gameplay. Consequently, learning occurs only tangentially and mainly due to the contents. However, providing contents non-related with game mechanics (e.g., by inserting long texts, almost independent from the actual gameplay) leads to games that are boring or not able to achieve their educational target. In this context, we are using the LM-GM framework as a means to determine atwhich point gameplay and pedagogy intert wine, which is a key concern for S Gdesign.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The first step of the model application consists of the identification and description of the actual game and learning mechanics. The resulting analysis, reported in Table 3, suggests that the gameplay follows a constructivist nature of learning, experienced by the player in a roughly sequential order from top to bottom.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To establish the pedagogical intent of the game mechanics, it is necessary to understand that the content of Re-Mission was designed to achieve game-based behavioural change, thus it addresses behavioural issues. The gameplay was designed through a rational engineering approach, which produced the definition of six core principles that were implemented in the game (Tate et al, 2009):</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">P1 Choose a target health outcome: this defines the learning outcome for each game level.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">P2 Identify its key behavioural mediators: this defines the risk associations with poor adherence of medication.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">P3 Define the psychological determinants of behaviour: this defines the behaviour that must change to address P2.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">P4 Capture that perceptual field in the gameplay: this was designed to remind that all may not be as well as thought, ie, that cancer could still be prevailing.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">P5 Live out contingencies in the virtual world instead of real life: this was designed such that the player can observe the consequences of poor medication behaviour.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">P6 Always have fun (Behaviour = Knowledge x Motivation): the aim was purely to express that through fun the game can effectively generate overt behaviour change.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The execution of principles P3-P6, which specifically target achievement of learning outcomes, is of particular interest in our analysis. From the observation, it is possible to note that the game was designed to cycle through these principles for each individual health outcome, with each level targeting a different outcome. Gamers who are familiar with the TPS genre may quickly recognise this gameplay "loop" and recognise its relevant game mechanics (Figure 3). P5, which relates to the negative consequences of poor treatment adherence, is of particular interest. The LM-GM framework identifies this as creating a protégé effect in the user, in which they learn the motivation for their own correct behaviour by teaching another person or entity the correct set of actions. This seems to be a core concept of the learning principle behind Re-Mission.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">What is the logical relationship between GMs and SGMs? In Re-Mission, the mechanics associated with player actions fall under the protégé effect, in which the action of teaching others is used as a learning tool. This is similar to a forward model in distal supervised learning, as evidenced by each Re-Mission assignment, where the player is informed of a case history and the mission prior to launching into the game. Additionally, during the mission preview, the non-player character adviser discusses strategies for battling a specific ailment. The mechanics are now beginning to blend into pedagogy. In having a protégé effect, one considers the game mechanic as engaged in the action of "teaching." The protégé effect is not a learning goal but is the SGM through which the goal can be achieved. In Re-Mission, the goal was identified with imparting health-related suggestions and motivations to the player, teaching patients to take responsibility for their own health.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This case study has shown how LM-GM can help identify both high-level learning goals and lower levels LMs, SGMs and GMs. In the following section, we are interested in validating the model through user tests.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Validation and evaluation</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the following sections, we present the experimental results of tests we have performed to validate the use of LM-GM as an SG analysis tool. In particular, we discuss two user studies: the first one examining the effectiveness of LM-GM in comparison with a state-of-the-art model, namely Amory's updated GOM, and the second one evaluating users' acceptance of LM-GM.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">GOM was chosen as its methodology was viewed as effective to describe the relationships between a pedagogical dimension of learning and its game elements. The diagrammatic mapping of the game-learning relationships in GOM was also considered as most complementary to LM-GM. We thus set up a comparison test to ascertain if LM-GM could address better the bridging between the pedagogical dimension of learning and its game elements, particularly the existence of SGMs. The evaluations were independently conducted and validated at two different hosting sites. The participants include a mix of academics, students and game developers from various countries, all of whom had some gaming experience.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The actual user evaluations were preceded by a comparison test to check whether the two models were comparable, as we demonstrate in the following.</p><a id="AN0101622040-5" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_49" title="Comparison of LM-GM and GOM">Comparison of LM-GM and GOM</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A fitness and comparison test was performed by 26 participants from UK, China and Mexico. Participants first identified the relationships between elements in the LM-GM framework considering the context of the SGM description; the outcome is presented in Figure 4. The SGM acts as the mechanism by which concrete learning activities are connected, as defined by the pedagogical patterns, to abstract design game elements. The abstract game layer represents game dynamics (e.g., achievements) as defined by game design patterns, which in turn can be mapped as a function of several GMs. This represents a many-to-one relationship between the abstract and concrete elements of game design and learning. A single abstract learning objective can be achieved by different learning activities, and a single Game Dynamic can be achieved through several different GMs. It should be noted that the abstract and concrete elements have been identified with respect to Amory's model, literature findings and from objective responses by participants in the case study described in the previous section. Unlike Figure 2, the relationship diagram in Figure 4 is not ordered top down but simply represents elements considered to be abstract or concrete within LM-GM, without any sorting. Originally combined elements, such as fun, challenge, quick feedback and story, have been separated to provide better abstract and concrete discretisation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Once we established that the models are comparable, we could assess the effectiveness of each model in supporting users in evaluating serious games. It is important to highlight that the goal of the experiment was not to evaluate the participants' ability to analyse a game but to have them assess the two different models by concretely applying it. This was clearly stated to all the participants prior to the tests.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">User evaluation 1</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The first user test was designed to evaluate how effective each model was in enabling users to analyse gameplay and the purpose of SGs and in particular to determine to what extent the models facilitated the recognition of connections between game mechanics and pedagogical intentions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Two games were used in this user study: the already mentioned Re-Mission and Serious Games Interactive's Playing History: The Plague (<a href="http://www.playinghistory.eu/">http://www.playinghistory.eu</a>), a role playing game in which the player explores medieval Florence in search of a cure for the plague, experiencing history and the living conditions from that time through the eyes of the protagonist. Ten students (nine males, one female), with ages varying from 21 to 40 years old (mean = 25.7, standard deviation = 5.46), were recruited to participate in the study. All of them were pursuing their bachelor's or master's degrees in Electronic Engineering in Italy at the time. The majority of the participants (80%) reported being at least somewhat familiar with games in general. Familiarity with SGs, on the other hand, was not so high: 70% of the participants declared low or very low familiarity with this specific type of games.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">For the analysis, participants were equally divided into two groups. Both groups played the first game, Re-Mission, and were then asked to complete an open-ended questionnaire about their understanding of the purpose of the game and their understanding of how well the game supported learning in each category of the Bloom's revised taxonomy (remembering, understanding, applying, analysing, evaluating and creating) (see Table 2; Anderson &amp; Krathwohl, 2001). This was done to establish a baseline of their understanding of the game. Subsequently, the first group received an account on how to evaluate a game using the list of components identified by the GOM (Amory, 2007), whereas the second group received an explanation about the LM-GM model. Both groups were asked to perform an evaluation of Re-Mission using their assigned model. After performing the analysis, participants were required to complete the same questionnaire, being instructed to change their answers if they felt they had new insights on the game after analysing it using the model presented to them. The same procedure was repeated with the second game, Playing History: The Plague, inverting the models assigned to each group. At the end of the study, participants were asked to make comments about both models. Figure 5 illustrates the workflow for each group.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Two evaluators rated the participants' responses independently in a scale of 1 to 5, according to the following criteria: clarity, appropriateness, presence of examples to illustrate answers, ability to identify game mechanics, ability to identify learning intentions and outcomes, and ability to identify connections between game mechanics and learning mechanics.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It was identified that three participants were seemingly tired or uninterested, for their answers were judged as unmindful or careless by both evaluators. Those three cases were ignored in the analysis. In addition, the question regarding creation of new content (the uppermost level of Bloom's taxonomy) was largely misunderstood by participants and was also disregarded in this study.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Ratings from both evaluators were averaged for each question. Next, the scores for all questions were averaged again to obtain one score for each participant in each one of the conditions (pre-GOM, post-GOM, pre-LM-GM and post-LM-GM). The resulting values are shown in Table 4 above.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">A Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test was conducted for each of the two models, comparing before and after scores. For the GOM, because of the small sample size and the number of repeated scores, the test could not determine any significant difference between conditions (t = 0, p = 0.125, two-tailed test, n = 4). On the other hand, for LM-GM, the same test indicated that participants improved their scores after performing the analysis of the game (t = 0, p = 0.031, two-tailed test, n = 6). The Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test excludes pairs of samples with zero difference (entries shaded in Table 4), effectively reducing the sample size n in the pre- and post-conditions to 4 and 6 respectively. Although the sample size of this study was too small to provide conclusive results, this exercise enabled us to draw preliminary conclusions regarding the effectiveness of both models. Although GOM allows users to reflect over quite general characteristics of the game, LM-GM appears to invite users to focus on lower level mechanics of the game play. On the other hand, LM-GM seems to be more complicated to be understood, in particular by novices. Nevertheless, LM-GM seems to support better the recognition of the connections between game and learning mechanics, even if in a simple way. In addition, LM-GM seems to have a higher educational value, supporting learning as it familiarises users with the terminology and concepts that are fundamental for understanding games (e.g., protégé effect, role play, game turns, infinite gameplay). As one participant put it, the [LM-GM] method is a bit more difficult to understand, but more adequate to answer the questions; the [Game Object Model] is simpler and more descriptive, but did not make me change my [understandings on how the game supported learning].</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">User evaluation 2</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the second user study, 26 individuals (13 from UK, 10 from China and three from Mexico)were consulted regarding their perceptions on the usefulness of each model. The analysis of the game was performed by a mix of academics, students and game developers all of whom had some gaming experience. They analysed the gameplay independently using the LM-GM and GOM, and their analysis was combined and summarised in Table 3and Figure 3.Table 5presents a brief summary of the participants' appreciation of the LM-GM and Amory's GOM based on this activity.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The experimental protocol was as follows:</p><ol xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><li><span class="medium-normal"> Participants were provided information regarding the LM-GM nodes (Lim et al, 2013) and the GOM (Amory, 2007).</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> Participants had no training on using the LM-GM or GOM other than a sample and basic explanation on the flow of the nodes.

This was to cater for participants outside UK.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> Participants were given 4weeks to play and reflect on the game and to produce the LM-GM and GOM mappings. All participants analysed the Re-Mission gameplay independently and twice, once applying LM-GM, once GOM. To avoid order effects, half of the participants applied LM-GM first and the other half, GOM first.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> Participants complete a system usability scale (SUS) report, which is well established, a tool used in usability engineering (Brooke, 1996). The SUS report comprises 10 questions, which we employed for both the LM-GM and GOM.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal"> An interview was conducted upon receiving their LM-GM/GOM mapping and SUS report.</span></li></ol><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">It is important to note that SUS scores for individual items are not meaningful on their own. The scoring of SUS requires a composite measure of the overall usability. For LM-GM, with 26 participants, the SUS average was 67.3. GOM SUS average was 46.7.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In agreement with the findings of the first study, the majority of the participants felt GOM was much easier to use but conversely found that it did not allow basic pedagogical and game patterns to be identified. A key reason was GOM's overlapping "spaces," which did not illustrate the flow of the game-learning elements. This is supported by the responses that participants gave when queried about the ability of GOM to link learning and game intent. The observations suggest that GOM is somewhat superficial and does not take the flow of gameplay into account. The fact that participants considered GOM easier to understand although being less effective points to the direction that the LM-GM model should be made easier to apply, providing better description of the utilisation workflow.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Two participants with some experience in developing engineering games provided succinct feedback during the interview highlighting that GOM "does not address how to implement learning objectives or to enable mapping of learning mechanics to game mechanics" and that "I can't see where GOM enables core instructional design to be made. The LM-GM has the advantage here."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To prevent bias with the mix of participants (ie, the assumption that academics and game developers would fare better than people with no game analysis/design experience), a second study was solely conducted with students of an unrelated field. The demographic comprised 25 final-year engineering students, with limited game analysis experience. The same protocol described previously was used, and the results are tabulated in Table 6. A scanned result of one of the mappings is showed in Figure 6. The hypothesis is that given their experience in systems design and engineering analytics, they would be able to apply that knowledge together with the supporting material (in protocol step 1) to use the LM-GM and Amory to map the process of gameplay and learning elements in Re-Mission.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As with the first evaluation, half of the participants started with LM-GM, the other half with GOM. Comments from this second evaluation pointed clearly that some prior knowledge for using LM-GM would be useful; however, the material provided with LM-GM did indeed help them use the model. When queried on the "ease of use," it turns out that the LM-GM informative material supplied meant much reading, compared with the GOM, which operates at a much higher level. Hence, LM-GM scored lower. Interestingly, all the participants found that the LM-GM node descriptors actually helped them carry out the GOM mapping better.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The LM-GM SUS average for this second evaluation was 71.4. GOM SUS average was 43.7. Comparing with the first evaluation, it confirms that the LM-GM is more capable than GOM to support game analysis, and the difference is even stronger in a population not expert of game analysis/design.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Although there are missing components in both the LM and the GM, these initial results reveal that the LM-GM is able to provide insights into the pedagogical and gaming patterns of a game. This work presents the first step in completing the larger puzzle and providing game designers and educators a more practical conceptual tool to effectively implement educational mechanisms in SGs.</p><a id="AN0101622040-6" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_71" title="Conclusions and further research">Conclusions and further research</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The main focus of this paper was to discuss the definition of the mechanics of serious games towards providing a more systematic view of the relationship between pedagogical principles and game elements. In our work, we have found that SG design has been linked with entertainment game design, particularly in the context of adopted game mechanics. In particular, our work has revealed particular strengths of some game mechanics that are typical of entertainment games and are also suited for serious and educational games.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This paper reports studies that were performed using the LM-GM model--a framework we have developed for SGMs analysis--that addresses the mismatch between game mechanics and educational components/aims. We demonstrated through a case study how LM-GM could support the evaluation of SGs, enabling the recognition of low-level game mechanics and their connections to pedagogical intentions. We also described the results of a comparative study between the LM-GM model and the state-of-the-art GOM framework, reporting on LM-GM's effectiveness and users' appreciation of its usability and usefulness.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Beside the content presentation aspect, which is covered in the LM-GM's current version, effective SGs for education and training also demand proper user assessment, in order to allow meeting the educational goals and provide appropriate user feedback (De Gloria, Bellotti &amp; Berta, 2012). Stealth or embedded assessment looks particularly effective, as it allows evaluating the player without breaking the flow experience (Shute, Ventura, Bauer &amp; Zapata-Rivera, 2009). Thus, we plan to upgrade the LM-GM model concerning the support of mechanics for in-game assessment (Bellotti, Kapralos, Lee, Moreno-Ger &amp; Berta, 2013). The LM-GM does not consider a player model yet. However, adaptation and personalisation are key factors for education (Bellotti, Berta, De Gloria &amp; Primavera, 2010b). Thus, inserting this new dimension in the model is a significant challenge for the future research.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The LM-GM framework has the ambitious goal of becoming a general tool that can be employed by game designers and domain expert (including teachers) interested in developing and/or analysing SGs. The earlier version of LM-GM has been considered in the design and analysis of a game called PR: EPARe (Arnab et al, 2013), which demonstrates the potential for it to be used to aid and inform game design. However, the scope of this tool in its present state is still limited. In this paper, in particular, we have shown its validity as an SG analysis tool. Further work includes refining the LM-GM with regard to the development of its prescriptive aspect, which involves suggesting preferential mapping of learning goals to game mechanics. This is being prepared through extensive SG studies that are being carried out within GALA (Bellotti et al, 2012a)--capitalising on a knowledge management system dedicated to SGs and based on an SG taxonomy (Popescu &amp; Bellotti, 2012)--and should enhance the framework's effectiveness as a design tool, meeting the emerging requirements from developers and stakeholders. Another challenging addition will be the inclusion of a neurophysiological analysis of a user behaviour during gameplay (Berta, Bellotti, De Gloria, Pranantha and Schatten 2013). Finally, appropriate support for integrating the use of a game within a given curriculum should also be studied and specified.</p><a id="AN0101622040-7" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_76" title="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">This work has been cofunded by the EU under the FP7, in the Games and Learning Alliance (GALA) Network of Excellence, Grant Agreement nr. 258169.Thisworkwas supported in part by the Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate in Interactive and Cognitive Environments, which is funded by the EACEA Agency of the European Commission under EMJD ICE FPA n 2010-0012.</p><a id="AN0101622040-8" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_78" title="Practitioner Notes">Practitioner Notes</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">What is already known about this topic</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* Early studies have demonstrated the valuable contributions of game-based approaches in education and training.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* Early work has revealed particular strengths in some entertainment game mechanics, some of which look suited for serious and educational games.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* Existing practices, framework, models in serious games design focus on providing guidelines and methods for design, but they do not target the analysis of the relationships between game elements and learning mechanics, which is a key factor in game design for learning.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* Games and learning have separate mechanics and Serious Games Mechanics (SGMs) have yet to be defined.

The last several years have seen the release of a conspicuous number of games that borrow tropes from psychological trauma theory. Examples include Dear Esther (The Chinese Room), Trauma (Krystian Majewski), Amnesia: The Dark Descent (Frictional Games), the perennial Silent Hill series (Konami), and Lone Survivor (Superflat Games). Even some so-called triple-A games, often decried as the gaming equivalent of the "brainless" Hollywood blockbuster, have begun to refer to trauma on occasion. in Deus Ex: Human Revolution (Eidos Montreal), for example, the player-character, Adam Jensen, is asked about the traumatic impact of the extensive mechanical augmentations he received in order to revive him from an otherwise fatal injury. One of the available replies -- "I never asked for this. They say they saved me, but I'm not sure saved is the right word" -- casts Jensen's individual trauma as an allegory of the traumatic impact of cybernetics on the troubled body politic of 2027. More controversially, the Tomb Raider prequel (Square Enix), which might as well be titled The Passion of the Croft, depicts Lara Croft barely surviving a series of physical and psychological traumas, including a near-rape. These events are shown to be the foundation of her development into an iconically strong and independent character. Despite the use of trauma in these high-profile examples, games have generally remained under the radar of trauma theorists who tend to focus more on traditional forms such as films, novels, and testimonies.[<a id="bib1up

Despite the admirable inclusivity of his study, however, even Luckhurst makes no reference to games. There are two possible explanations for the general lack of recognition of games by trauma theorists. The first, and simplest, is that the novelty of videogames means that trauma theory has simply not yet caught up -- after all, the most visible examples of games which reference trauma began to appear only after The Trauma Question was published (2008). The second and more worrisome possibility is that a popular perception of games as a fun distraction persists, in spite of the work currently being done by games developers, theorists, and journalists to valorize games as a "serious" artistic medium.[<a id="bib2up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2" title="2">2</a>] Justified or not, any preconception about the flippancy of games versus books or films artificially limits the potential scope of trauma studies. The first decade of the twenty-first century has seen the games industry skyrocket past films and books in terms of sales figures, if not cultural prominence, in both the United States and the United Kingdom.[<a id="bib3up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib3" id="ref_linkbib3" title="3">3</a>] In order to maintain currency in this rapidly shifting media ecology, trauma studies must step up to the challenge of examining new media in order to test and reapply, in unfamiliar contexts, lessons learned from its long and fruitful history.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Limbo, a 2D platform game released by Playdead in 2010, provides a recent and prominent example of a game that has achieved critical and commercial success by remediating some of the rhetorical tropes and themes found in the more "traditional" types of trauma fiction discussed by Luckhurst. Limbo uses the unique characteristics of the game medium to make the player feel alternately shocked, guilty, anxious, and powerless -- a spectrum of feelings strongly associated with psychological trauma. Moreover, Limbo thematizes trauma through its distinctive esthetic and narrative, what games theorist Frans Mayra has referred to as the "shell" of a game, as well as conveying trauma through its "core" -- the underlying rules and mechanics that allow the game to be played (Mäyrä 17-18). Games are distinguished from other media such as films or books by being what Espen Aarseth calls "ergodic": to produce a meaningful experience, they require a "nontrivial effort" from an actively participating player who is given a sense of agency within the fictional world (<a id="bib1up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib1" id="ref_linkbib1" title="1">1</a>). This agency is frequently accompanied by the possibility of failure: games risk being dull unless they provide interesting challenges for the player to overcome. In many games, this leads to trial-and-error situations where the player might fail several times before finally succeeding at a task and being allowed to progress, and these failures are quite often illustrated by the player-character's death. To progress through Limbo, which level designer Jeppe Carlsen calls "a learning- by-dying game" (Sheffield), the player will inevitably end up causing the death of the protagonist -- a small boy -- in countless gory ways. Limbo cleverly exploits the relationship between player and protagonist in order to shock the player, making them feel responsible for each individual death. Limbo is not capable of traumatizing the player directly. Rather, Limbo's visuals, sound, and mechanics work in harmony to mount what Ian Bogost has called a "procedural" argument about how it might feel to be traumatized -- a virtual representation of the symptoms of trauma experienced by the player through play.[4 ]Just as one experiences a book by reading it, or a testimony by listening to it, one experiences a game by playing it; my analysis grapples with this complex and undertheorized mode of engagement. Although games represent a medium with a unique and relatively untapped expressive potential, this does not devalue more traditional or canonical trauma texts. Rather, games can use the idiosyncrasies of their medium to work with trauma differently.</p><a id="AN0110404955-2" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_5" title="Trauma Studies and Trauma Fiction">Trauma Studies and Trauma Fiction</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The term "trauma," originally derived from the Greek for "wound," has shifted in meaning considerably over the course of the last century and a half, and has become especially prevalent over the last three decades. After discussing traumatic neuroses associated with hysteria in the 1890s, Freud further popularized the idea of trauma as a mental rather than a physical wound in his struggle to explain the peculiar symptoms of shell-shocked soldiers returning from the battlefields of the First World War. These symptoms included nervous tics, sleeplessness, amnesia, hysterical mutism or paralysis, stammering, depression, and oversensitivity to sudden noise. In Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud noted that although his patients were not consciously preoccupied with remembering traumatic events -- in fact, many of them actively repressed memories of the war -- they nevertheless tended to compulsively repeat them long after they occurred, acting them out unwillingly in dreams, flashbacks, and hallucinations. Because the original trauma happened so suddenly, Freud argued, its victims found themselves completely unprepared to process the event as it occurred (in the trenches, long periods of boredom and inactivity were interspersed with sudden bombardments and surprise attacks). Freud reasoned that by unconsciously putting themselves through the traumatizing incident again and again, victims were able to build up their mental resistance to it retroactively until it could finally be worked through consciously and incorporated into the patient's life story as an ordinary memory (what Freud's contemporary, the Salpâtrière psychologist Pierre Janet, referred to as "narrative memory"). Coupled with this repetition compulsion, Freud found that many of his patients appeared to be perfectly healthy during or immediately after the war, and began to decline only in subsequent years. The delay between suffering the initial trauma and manifesting its various symptoms was termed "latency."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the wake of the Second World War, the Holocaust, Vietnam, and the Gulf War, Freudian ideas about trauma have been reinterpreted by a variety of academics, clinical professionals, cultural theorists, literary scholars, and historians. Most notable in the field of literary or cultural trauma theory is the work of Cathy Caruth, whose edited collection Trauma: Explorations in Memory established the pattern that cultural trauma research would follow for at least the next ten years.[<a id="bib5up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib5" id="ref_linkbib5" title="5">5</a>] For Caruth, the defining characteristic of the traumatic flashback is the fact that it cannot be understood by its victim, even as it provides a (supposedly) faithful image of the original traumatic event: "the flashback or traumatic reenactment conveys, that is, both the truth of an event, and the truth of its incomprehensibility' (153). According to Caruth, once the trauma is put into words, it risks losing "both the precision and the force that characterizes traumatic recall" (153). The troublesome implication is that working through or trying to address the trauma directly actually betrays the truth of the traumatic event, and as such the only "real" trauma is an unprocessed one. Because of this, the reality of a traumatic history "can only be perceived in unassimilable forms" (156). In cultural trauma theory, therefore, it becomes the writer's or filmmaker's ethical responsibility to find the "unassimilable forms" through which the impact of trauma can be effectively conveyed to the audience without dissipating its truth. Well-known examples of what has been termed "trauma fiction" include Alain Resnais's Hiroshima mon amour (1959), W. G. Sebald's Austerlitz, Pat Barker's Regeneration trilogy, and Jonathan Safran Foer's Everything Is Illuminated.[<a id="bib6up

By innovating with the interactivity and player agency that define them as a medium, games have the power not only to match these trauma fictions in representing the trauma of the victim rhetorically but also to involve the player in the complicity, guilt, and potential trauma of the perpetrator through methods uniquely available to games.</p><a id="AN0110404955-3" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_8" title="Thematizing Trauma">Thematizing Trauma</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Created over a period of six years by the independent Danish developer Playdead, Limbo was released to great critical acclaim on Xbox Live Arcade in 2010, then on Microsoft Windows, Mac, and other major formats in 2011. The player controls a small and vulnerable boy, who -- in accordance with classic platformer conventions -- must make his way from left to right through the titular limbo, searching for his lost sister while avoiding deadly traps, obstacles, and creatures. At first glance, the most striking thing about Limbo is its setting and art direction -- its "shell," as Mäyrä would have it. The game's simple plot and control scheme is complemented by the use of black-and- white silhouette graphics to represent the world and its various inhabitants, and overlaid with a film grain postprocessing effect which gestures toward early cinema, especially film-noir. The audio is similarly striking: drawing on the principles of acousmatic music, which shuns traditional instruments in favor of electronically produced, disembodied sounds; musician and sound designer Martin Stig Andersen blends diegetic and nondiegetic audio into a dissonant, fractured, but still curiously musical soundscape of whirring blades, clanking and humming machines, footsteps, lapping water, and buzzing insects.[<a id="bib7up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib7" id="ref_linkbib7" title="7">7</a>] Taken together, these design decisions not only lend the game its distinctive look and feel, they also channel some of the symptoms, emotions, and discourses associated with psychological trauma. The washed-out, black-and-white visuals, for example, evoke uncertainty, melancholia, and emotional numbing. The audio works in a slightly more complex way: cues like the aforementioned whir of saws are used to alert the player to dangers before they actually appear, but because of the acousmatic principles at work the noises are not always directly attributable to objects within the game world, while some dangers make no noise at all. This can be disorienting, and, combined with the indistinct, gloomy backgrounds, leads to a state of anxiety in the player who can never be sure from which dark corner of Limbo the next threat will emerge. In the article "Fight or Flight: The Neuroscience of Survival Horror," published on Gamasu- tra.com, Maral Tajerian suggests that there are good design reasons for causing the player to feel anxiety, which she defines as "a response to a future potential threat":</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">While games like first person shooters are notorious for desensitizing players to violence, games that raise the player's anxiety actually sensitize them to danger. This is simply how animals behave, and it's a highly adaptive behavior, since it keeps individuals on their toes in anxiety-causing environments. Raising the levels of anxiety in a video game will therefore ensure that the player is sensitized to the danger of the game.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">By harnessing anxiety to foster a constant awareness of potential dangers, Limbo not only ensures that the player remains completely immersed in the game, it also creates an environment in which some of the symptoms of trauma, such as hypervigilance and oversensitivity to certain stimuli associated with the traumatic event, can be virtually experienced.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The game's setting is also significant. Sufferers of trauma are often described as being trapped in limbo, unable to move beyond a certain moment, which they relive over and over through dreams and night- mares.[<a id="bib8up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib8" id="ref_linkbib8" title="8">8</a>] The setting is revealing in the way it ties urbanization and technological development to trauma. In Lamentation and Modernity in Literature, Philosophy, and Culture, Rebecca Saunders argues that "[a] lthough it has come colloquially to cover a broad range of experience, including modern life itself, trauma is the product of a specific sociopolitical and clinical genealogy that emerges with late modernity. It is an artifact that responds to symptoms produced by modern technology, warfare, and social relations" (<a id="bib11up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib11" id="ref_linkbib11" title="11">11</a>). Saunders encapsulates here a widespread view that the rise of trauma as a psychiatric and social discourse is inseparable from the experience of living in a modernized, alienating, industrial world. Indeed, many of the earliest (1860s to 1890s) discussions of trauma revolved around train crashes and the effort by railway, legal, and health authorities to determine the appropriate level of compensation to be awarded to victims of accidents, based on an assessment of the psychological versus neurological nature of their symptoms.[<a id="bib9up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib9" id="ref_linkbib9" title="9">9</a>] The trauma epidemic of the First World War, moreover, would not have been possible without the introduction of industrial processes into the practice of warfare -- the notorious assembly line killing enabled by machine guns and routinized artillery barrages. Limbo thematizes the entanglement of modernity and trauma by transitioning from a rural landscape to an industrialized one over the course of play. The game opens in a forest setting, then moves to an abandoned and run-down cityscape before finally segueing into a factory where hazards include saw blades, arcs of electricity, and enormous cogs and gears. As this shift occurs, the protagonist's deaths become more impersonal: they are no longer attributable to "natural" hazards such as falling or drowning, or even the intentional, directed violence from the hostile tribe of other boys, or the terrifying giant spider which stalks the protagonist through the forest. Rather, the dangers in the latter sections of the game arise simply through the player's attempts to move the boy through industrialized spaces that are not designed to accommodate his fragile human body. Much like the train accidents mentioned above, the machines in the later sections of Limbo cause death as a result of largely automated processes without malicious intent, or indeed any intent at all. At this point, the player feels neither welcome nor unwelcome, but is instead merely alienated from a system that would keep trundling on with or without the protagonist's intervention. The feelings of disembeddedness, isolation, and the randomness and meaninglessness of injury and death are key markers of trauma and the modernity from which it arises.</p><a id="AN0110404955-4" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_13" title="Mechanizing Trauma">Mechanizing Trauma</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Analyzing the esthetics of the game only tells half the story, though. In order to more fully understand how Limbo plays with the concept of trauma, we must closely examine how the experience of the player is driven by the core rules and mechanics -- especially rules about death -- that lie behind the game's audiovisual shell. As hinted at above, the list of ways to die in Limbo is enormous: the protagonist can be shocked, stabbed, beheaded, crushed, drowned, poisoned, burned, impaled by the giant spider, and so on. Each of these fates is animated uniquely according to the game's ragdoll physics engine, which takes over at the point of death. Before being allowed to reload from the most recent checkpoint and make another attempt, the player is forced to sit through the death sequence for several seconds, watching the life drain from the boy as his glowing white eyes go hauntingly dark. Due to the game's high level of difficulty (which is not adjustable), this is an all-too frequent occurrence. Admittedly, a fascination with causing and gruesomely animating the player-character's death is not uncommon among videogame developers, especially when it comes to indie games, which are typically less afraid of antagonizing the player than big-budget games developed for mass- market appeal. Titles such as Dragon's Lair (Cinematronics), the Ninja Gaiden series (Tecmo), Super Ghouls'n Ghosts (Capcom), I Wanna Be the Guy (Michael "Kayin" O'Reilly), Super Meat Boy (Team Meat), and Dark Souls (From Software) are infamous for their high levels of difficulty; the latter three games in particular have generated a loyal following among hardcore gamers thirsting for a challenge.[<a id="bib10up

Though they are arguably of the same level of difficulty (if not harder), the way that Limbo handles death is different enough from its peers to merit closer inspection. In a review of the game posted on popular PC gaming news Web site Rockpapershotgun.com, John Walker points toward this:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">[T]he role death plays is [] interesting. Commonly games rooted in solving puzzles are criticised for not being possible to solve without dying first [] But Limbo does something strange with this. Just at the point where the accusation could be reasonably levelled, it presents you with a sequence that's nothing but pure defiance. Two blocks are suspended in the sky, and under each is what looks like might be a large button. If you proceed in a certain way under the first block it falls on you and kills you. So you start the sequence over, do it correctly and run to the second. Again you repeat the safe technique and it drops on you and kills you. The only way past this second block would be the method that kills you on the first. It's deliberately impossible to know without trial and error -- the game is messing with you. It wants you to be dying.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Walker surmises these transgressions of platformer conventions to be "part of the overall looming oppression that is Limbo." However, by ensuring the vulnerable player-character's death, illustrating those deaths in a shocking way, and forcing the player to re-experience them many times over, Limbo actually engages with the trauma paradigm discussed above. To explain this, I examine what happens during the moment of death, taking account of the complex relationship between the player, the fragile protagonist, and the menacing game world.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Only a surprisingly small amount of research has been conducted so far to determine exactly how players of videogames relate to the character they play, much of it derived from ideas developed in the different contexts of books, films, or social science.[<a id="bib11up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib11" id="ref_linkbib11" title="11">11</a>] Traditionally, marketing for games has relied on the idea that by playing as a certain character, the player becomes that character for the duration of the game. This has allowed advertisers to sell games as escapist power fantasies: by playing Epic Games's Gears of War, for example, the player "becomes" protagonist Marcus Fenix, a hulking embodiment of masculine strength and savior of humanity -- an appealing role for many. The vernacular used to advertise older games is particularly telling, as it often addresses the potential buyer directly as "you," eliding the ontological gap between player and protagonist. For example, the blurb for Bullfrog's classic strategy game Syndicate, puts the player directly in the protagonist's shoes: "You are an ambitious marketing director in the Syndicate, hand-picked to lead a team of cyborg mercenaries. You work in the problem-solving department and you are damn good at 'taking care' of problems. Some might say that violence is not the answer but you know better. There are hardly any problems that you can't solve with a well- placed bullet." While a process of identification with strong or ruthless characters may account to some extent for the appeal of certain games to a limited demographic, the direct line it posits between player and character does not stand up to scrutiny, especially given the large number of games without a central protagonist, with a completely abstract protagonist, or with several available protagonists. In a football game, for instance, the player typically has the ability to alternate their control of different characters at the press of a button. During a single match the player could feasibly control every member of the team in turn. With whom do they identify in this case? Is it possible for one person to "be" an entire football team? And in more abstract games such as chess, can the player feel that they "are" a chess piece?</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In order to address questions like these, James Newman has suggested that, "for the controlling player during gameplay sequences, the notion of 'character' is inappropriate. Here, 'character' is better considered as a suite of characteristics or equipment utilized and embodied by the controlling player. The primary-player-character relationship is one of vehicular embodiment." In the moment of play, which Newman terms On-Line engagement, the representational traits of the character essentially disappear as the player focuses on completing tasks or overcoming obstacles in order to progress, even though the character under their control remains visible on-screen (as in a third-person game, strategy game, or platformer). This is contrasted with Off-Line engagement, when the player watches cutscenes or title sequences, reads text, or is otherwise prevented from directly interacting with the game world. (According to Newman, this category can also encompass passive participants who watch someone else play.) At these points the character reappears, as it were, in order to engage in dialog, perform scripted actions, or transition to a new area and move the story of the game forwards. Newman argues that Off-Line and On-Line should be thought of as forming different ends of a continuum; in many modern games, cutscenes feature elements of interactivity such as quick time events (QTEs), which allow the player to intervene in otherwise scripted sequences. Conversely, On-Line gameplay segments can often be heavily scripted to the point that they are indistinguishable from extended cutscenes, rendering them basically noninteractive (a complaint frequently leveled at "corridor" shooters, which use invisible walls and triggered sequences to lead the player down a certain route).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The transition between On-Line and Off-Line states helps to explain the football game example above. Football games often use the names and faces of real players Off-Line -- in loading screens, full- motion videos (FMVs), etc. -- in order to establish them as characters with whom the player might wish to identify.[<a id="bib12up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib12" id="ref_linkbib12" title="12">12</a>] However, once the virtual referee's whistle is blown and the game commences, these representational characteristics disappear. With their attention solely focused on the necessity of winning the match, the On-Line player does not select Wayne Rooney because they desire to "be" him through a process of identification (although this may have driven the player's decision to include him in the team prior to the match); rather, the On-Line player decides whether or not to temporarily control the game piece designated as Wayne Rooney based on its current position on the field and its ability to shoot, defend, or sprint, as laid down within the rules of the game. The same can be said of a chess piece: for a player deeply involved in the game at hand, the pawn is not (usually) selected because the player identifies with the role of an individual foot soldier and adapts (or role-plays) their actions accordingly; instead the pawn is maneuvered according to an overarching strategy, which renders every game piece as a node within a complex, relational network giving rise to a near-endless variety of possible plays. Leading on from this logic, and noting that "player accounts are structured around action, around environment, around activity," Newman suggests that "the primary-player may not see themselves as any one particular character on the screen, but rather as the sum of every force and influence that comprises the game." In other words, it is possible that a player relates not just to the character they play, as the marketing material for Syndicate would have us believe, but in fact identifies with the entire space of the game world, which includes all of the game's characters, esthetics, mechanics, goals, and events. In light of this, it is tempting to refer not just to a character in a game, but instead to the character of a game.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Tantalizing as it is, this radical theory of identification must be explored at greater length elsewhere. Newman's differentiation between Off-Line and On-Line engagement applies handily to Limbo and can help explain how the repeated deaths of the protagonist represent the symptoms of trauma. As suggested above, when the player controls the boy, they use him as a tool or vehicle for exploring the game space. The boy is able to jump a small distance, climb ladders, swing on ropes, run, and push and pull objects. According to Newman's logic, while he is doing these things under the player's control, the boy ceases to exist as a discrete character and instead becomes no more than an extension of the player's will into the game world.[13 ]Limbo seems quite aware of the nature of this relationship. Several times in the game the protagonist is attacked by parasitic slugs, which attach themselves to his head and control his actions, causing him to lurch forward into hazards. At these points player control is limited to either accelerating the lurch into a run, slowing it down to a zombielike walk, or jumping. The direction of movement cannot be changed, leading to a series of tense puzzle situations. The game- play mechanic of the slug and the player struggling for mastery over the same body serves as a sharp reminder that the On-Line player also functions as a kind of parasite, albeit one that usually goes unchallenged. Just like the head slug, the player also endangers the protagonist through their compulsive drive to move through the world, temporarily forgetting that they are the puppeteer of a small and fragile boy. This is where Limbo's approach to death becomes significant: by actively tricking the player into dying, the game routinely jars them out of this mindset. The player transitions from On-Line to Off-Line engagement for the few seconds it takes to watch the death of the protagonist and restore from the last checkpoint. In the precise moment when the player loses control of the game, that is, the boy reappears as a character in the throes of death.[<a id="bib14up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib14" id="ref_linkbib14" title="14">14</a>] Although various iterations of this "killcam" mechanic have existed in games for many years, the emotional effect it produces in Limbo is strengthened by the juxtaposition between the small boy's vulnerability and the brutality of his deaths within the overbearing, anxiety-inducing gloominess of the setting. Watching the boy die, the two most prominent emotions one experiences are shock and guilt: shock at the game's brutal depiction of a child's death, and guilt that the death has been caused by one's ineptitude as a player.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">By using the player's agency to produce responses like these, Limbo differs fundamentally from a film or novel, which might also seek to shock the viewer/reader by killing off a protagonist. In these linear, scripted forms, the death of a character is inevitable from the outset; the viewer/reader has no means of preventing it, and therefore no cause to feel guilty when it happens (though they may still feel upset by it). By contrast, even though it is highly unlikely that the player will complete a perfect run of Limbo, the possibility still exists, which makes the player's inability to do so all the more impactful.[<a id="bib15up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib15" id="ref_linkbib15" title="15">15</a>] By experimenting with the interactivity that defines its medium, then, Limbo puts the player in the fraught position of being both the cause of the death (On-Line) and the subsequent witness to it (Off-Line). If seeing even one such grisly mishap in real life can qualify as a traumatic experience -- as suggested by the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) -- then by having the player view and review the deaths within the game world, Limbo echoes the symptomatology of trauma, which sees sufferers trapped in a figurative limbo, continuously reliving their traumatic experience. This is not to imply that the player becomes traumatized by the game, nor that the protagonist becomes traumatized by the player's actions, but that the rhythms and emotions generated by the repetition of grisly deaths required to progress through the game echo some of the more salient features of psychological trauma, which the player is able to experience virtually, as a form of procedural rhetoric. Notably, in theories of trauma popularized by Bessel van der Kolk, Cathy Caruth, and others, traumatic repetition is supposed to be an exact copy of the original traumatic event. However, the deaths reproduced in Limbo are slightly different each time -- even dying on the same obstacle over and over can result in markedly different death sequences, due to the inherent unpredictability of the physics engine. Although it does not accord exactly with the notion of literal repetition, then, by representing the protagonist's deaths in the way that it does, Limbo manages to prevent numbing on the part of the player, and ensures that the impact of individual deaths remain fresh.[<a id="bib16up

Though it has gone unremarked so far, game journalism and trauma theory have a shared interest in the question of whether it is possible to identify with a mediated experience to the extent that it subsequently becomes an indistinguishable part of one's own identity. In the realm of games, this is manifested as the flip-side of marketing certain games as power fantasies or escapism. The question frequently asked in one form or another by news outlets and concern groups is: If it is possible to identify with a character in a game that normalizes violence, to the extent that the player can "become" that character for the duration of play, then is it also possible for elements of that character to seep into the player's personality outside the game world, after the game has ended? In other words, can playing violent games condition the player to more readily turn to violence in response to real-life problems?[<a id="bib17up
					"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib17" id="ref_linkbib17" title="17">17</a>] This question takes a different form in trauma theory, but it remains similar in terms of the link it posits between mediated experience and identity. Describing the relationship between first-hand testimonies of traumatic experiences and those who hear the testimony second-hand (viewers, interviewers, readers, or listeners), LaCapra warns against what he calls "unchecked identification":</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Unchecked identification implies a confusion of self and other which may bring an incorporation of the experience and voice of the victim and its reenactment or acting out. As in acting out in general, one possessed, however vicariously, by the past and reliving its traumatic scenes may be tragically incapable of acting responsibly or behaving in an ethical manner involving consideration for others as others. One need not blame the victim possessed by the past and unable to get beyond it to any viable extent in order to question the idea that it is desirable to identify with this victim, or to become a surrogate victim, and to write (or perform) in that incorporated voice. (28)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In other words, LaCapra suggests that it is possible for the secondhand witness to identify so strongly with an account of a traumatic experience that they come to adopt some of the symptoms of trauma, or even claim the trauma as their own. LaCapra opposes this appropriative identification with the notion of empathy or "empathic unsettlement," which "involves a kind of virtual experience through which one puts oneself in the other's position while recognizing the difference of that position and hence not taking the other's place" (78). Empathy, for LaCapra, is a method of listening whereby the second-hand witness recognizes the emotional impact of the traumatic narrative, even as they maintain the necessary critical distance to think it through objectively, without trying to possess it, or inadvertently becoming possessed by it. Empathic unsettlement involves being shaken out of the fantasy of witnessing whereby one would claim the traumatic experience as one's own. In Limbo, empathic unsettlement takes place as the shift between On-Line and Off-Line engagement occurs -- at the point of death. When we control the protagonist, we inhabit him and use him as a tool or vehicle for moving through the game. We are emotionally attached to him and wish to preserve him inasmuch as he is our inlet into a pleasurable identification with the game world as a whole. When he inevitably dies, empathic unsettlement kicks in, and the player realizes, as control is taken away from them, that the boy and the world he inhabits are different from the player, and that the player has in fact caused the boy to die. We wince as the boy dies, not because we feel his pain, but because we imagine what it would feel like if we were going through the pain ourselves; we experience his death virtually, and we realize our implication in it.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In the several years since Limbo's release, there have already been other notable attempts to incorporate guilt, perpetration, and trauma into games. In Yager Development's Spec Ops: The Line, for instance, the player controls Captain Martin Walker, a US military operative tasked with exploring the ruins of a sandstorm-ravaged Dubai and rescuing Lieutenant Colonel John Konrad, the PTSD-afflicted officer responsible for a failed evacuation attempt of the city which led to hundreds of innocent deaths. Unlike in Limbo, the player-character is made directly responsible for the deaths not only of UAE "insurgents," but also of civilians and the US troops under Konrad's command who have seemingly gone rogue. By the end of game, the player-character is depicted as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the deadly actions in which he has participated with various degrees of willingness and foreknowledge. Where Limbo strives to induce guilt and anxiety in the player through making them feel responsible for the repeated deaths of the protagonist, Spec Ops: The Line demonstrates the result of perpetrating violent acts directly, as their repercussions impact on the player- character's psyche. The difference between the player's position in these two cases is analogous to the difference between the soldier on the ground as a perpetrator of violence (Spec Ops) and the commander or general who orders troops into battle, with casualties as the unfortunate result (Limbo). In both cases, the player causes deaths and must view the outcome of their actions in gruesome detail, and both games use the inherent interactivity of the game medium in order to produce a sense of responsibility in the player.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As "serious" games continue to emerge -- games which challenge the player's preconceptions about "fun" by encouraging them to play through grisly scenarios and perpetrate heinous deeds, which they are then held accountable for -- it becomes increasingly important to attempt to read games through an interdisciplinary lens, borrowing insights from fields such as trauma studies, with its history of exploring the mediation of limit experiences. Likewise, trauma studies has much to learn by acknowledging the potential that games, with their radical dependence on interactivity and consequence, have for representing the trauma of both victimhood and perpetration. When one reads games from this interdisciplinary stance, it is imperative to take account of both the visual and aural motifs which the game uses to construct its world, as well as the experience of actually playing the game, that is, the activity of interacting with a game's ruleset and discovering how it works through experimentation. It is only by combining these two approaches that one is able to compile a fuller picture of how a game like Limbo channels the motifs and tropes of trauma.</p><a id="AN0110404955-5" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="ref_toc" title=" Notes  "> Notes  </a></span><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em><a id="bib1"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib1up" id="bib_upbib1" title="1.">1.</a>  See Cathy Caruth's Trauma: Explorations in Memory and Unclaimed Experience: Trauma, Narrative, and History, Shoshana Felman and Dori Laub's Testimony: Crises of Witnessing in Literature, Psychoanalysis and History, and Dominick LaCapra's Writing History, Writing Trauma and History and Memory, all of which focus primarily on clinical, literary, filmic, artistic, and autobiographical accounts of trauma.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em><a id="bib2"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib2up" id="bib_upbib2" title="2.">2.</a>  Games theorist Ian Bogost, for example, takes issue with how the notion of "fun" is understood in the context of games.

In 2000, Ruth Leys took Caruth to task, interrogating her sources in order to condemn the "theory of the literal nature of traumatic memory" as "inadequately formulated and weakly supported by the scientific evidence" (265). Roger Luckhurst has also cited Richard Terdiman to point out that "[t]he unconscious might seem to preserve pristine memories, but as soon as that 'eerie fixity' reached consciousness the traumatic memory 'exhibits a positively wanton disloyalty to the truth'" (12). Although her theories are not completely accurate, they still carry weight outside of academic circles, especially in terms of how they have diffused through popular understandings of trauma.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em><a id="bib6"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib6up" id="bib_upbib6" title="6.">6.</a>  Anne Whitehead's Trauma Fiction provides an excellent discussion of Sebald's and Barker's work in particular.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em><a id="bib7"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib7up" id="bib_upbib7" title="7.">7.</a>  A fascinating and rigorous interview with Andersen, in which he unpacks some of the thinking behind his sound design, can be found at <a href="http://designingsound.org/2011/08/limbo-exclusive-interview-with-martin-stig-andersen/">http://designingsound.org/2011/08/limbo-exclusive-interview-with-martin-stig-andersen/</a>.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em><a id="bib8"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib8up" id="bib_upbib8" title="8.">8.</a>  This is perhaps most memorably captured by Wilfred Owen in his poem "Mental Cases," where he describes First World War trauma victims as "purgatorial shadows."</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em><a id="bib9"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib9up" id="bib_upbib9" title="9.">9.</a>  Allan Young's The Harmony of Illusions: Inventing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder gives a helpful overview of these early debates.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em><a id="bib10"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib10up" id="bib_upbib10" title="10.">10.</a>  Due to the relatively limited file size and processing power offered by early computers, which limited the amount of content that designers could fit into their games, many older titles featured punishing difficulty levels not only as a method of artificially extending the length of the game for owners of home entertainment consoles (by forcing them to repeat sections over and over), but also to ensure a steady flow of coins from arcade-goers.

Kinesthetic projection owes much to cyborg theory, which posits tools as extensions of the body. It is "the idea that we can see tools as an extension of ourselves, that we can project our movement out onto the tools we use [] If you've ever been playing a game and the controller just, sort of, disappears and you [] lose the separation between you and the character on the screen, in some ways you become the character. You start to think 'I'm going to turn right,' rather than 'I'm going to turn my character right.' That's kinesthetic projection." Useful as it is, this idea falls short of Newman's theory of identification in its failure to consider the avatar as just one more tool which disappears as the player interacts with the game world (at least, during moments of On-Line engagement). The player does not become the player-character ("becoming" implies a two-way process in which the player adopts the personality of the player-character to some extent); instead the player inhabits the player-character in order to relate to the game world as a whole.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em><a id="bib14"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib14up" id="bib_upbib14" title="14.">14.</a>  This can be especially harrowing in cases where the player relinquishes control of the protagonist just before he is killed, while falling after mistiming a jump, for instance.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em><a id="bib15"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib15up" id="bib_upbib15" title="15.">15.</a>  The Steam achievement "No Point in Dying," awarded to those who "[c]omplete the game in one sitting with five or less deaths," is held by only 0.3 per cent of Limbo players at the time of writing, and it is impossible to tell how many of those players, if any, achieved no deaths at all.</em></p><p class="body-paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><em><a id="bib16"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#bib16up" id="bib_upbib16" title="16.">16.</a>  In The Longest Shadow: In the Aftermath of the Holocaust, Geoffrey Hartman uses the phrase "psychic numbing" to refer to the phenomenon of becoming tired of or inured to representations of trauma.

Her research investigates the undertheorized potential of video games to represent psychological trauma in ways that "traditional" trauma-fiction media such as novels, films, or autobiographies cannot. It argues that, because of the inter(re)activity which is unique to the video game medium, games are able to present a variety of ways of making the player identify and/or empathize with protagonists and, through them, to virtually experience traumatized perspectives or perpetrate traumatizing acts.</p><div><hr width="25%" noshade="noshade"><span class="medium-normal">Copyright of Journal of Popular Culture is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

This article provides instructional strategies to capitalize on these opportunities.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The rapid advances in technology within the last two decades have generated an increasing number of options for reading children's stories in portable formats beyond the ink-and-paper tradition. Mobile devices for reading are available to children today in the form of smartphones, electronic book readers (e-readers), and tablets, and a recent large-scale study found that up to half of U.S. children aged 8 or younger have one or more of these digital devices in their own home (Common Sense Media &amp; Rideout, 2011). This number is probably growing, as more adults now report owning at least one smartphone (55%), tablet (42%), or e-reader (32%; Pew Research Center, 2014).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">While studies on the "digital divide" have historically found that technology access tends to be divided along the lines of income levels and ethnic groups -- forming the "haves" and the "have nots" -- there is recent and encouraging research showing that once a low-income or ethnic-minority household does acquire the technology, the children in those homes are highly likely to have access to it (Gutnick, Robb, Takeuchi, &amp; Kotler, 2011). All of this data suggests that across ethnic groups and at all income levels, primary-grade students are bringing differing levels of exposure to, and understandings of, using a mobile device for reading. This also means that early childhood teachers must increasingly adapt their instructional practices to ensure that all emergent readers are learning to navigate digital stories effectively.</p><a id="AN0095772271-2" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_6" title="How Is Reading a Digital Story on a Mobile Platform Different?">How Is Reading a Digital Story on a Mobile Platform Different?</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We decided to conduct an exploratory study to identify not only the most common digital features of mobile reading apps but also the book-handling skills that readers must acquire in order to make use of them. In many ways, it may appear to the casual observer that the reading experience with print on a mobile device would not be much different: letters make words that form sentences that we read from left to right, as pictures and words work together to tell a story.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">However, on a mobile digital device such as an e-book reader (e.g., the Kindle or the Nook), opening a book to read cannot be accomplished by turning physically to the first page. There are menus to navigate and correct choices to be made. When using a smartphone or tablet to read with a digital story application, the reader may be presented with illustrations that can be sprung to life to learn more about the story, or there may be a narration feature available that matches audio to the onscreen writing to help less-experienced readers. This is not too surprising since, a few years ago, it was suggested that technology advances would create "a whole new set of texts and contexts for reading" (Duke, Schmar-Dobler, &amp; Zhang, 2006).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In this study, we found that digital story applications are taking large departures from paper-based text and, moreover, that these differences are currently presented to readers in multiple, sometimes unpredictable ways. A recent study by Guernsey, Levine, Chiong and Severns (2012) found that the most popular interactive elements of e-books on the iPhone and iPad platforms were narration and "hot spots" that responded to user touch, followed by games, sound capabilities, and text highlighting, none of which have an equivalent in a traditional printed book.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The findings from our study extend the idea that readers today need to master features and navigational tasks that are not present in paper books. This suggests that primary teachers need to expand their classroom instruction about how books work beyond what is already modeled using traditional paper readers and teacher's big books. We also observe that the nature of rapidly evolving software development is such that these digital story elements are subject to sudden change and to high levels of variability between applications.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We propose that in the face of this variability, young readers of digital texts must be encouraged to develop flexibility and persistence in the physical and mental navigation of evolving digital texts. This idea is consistent with cognitive flexibility theory (Spiro, Coulson, Feltovich &amp; Anderson, 2004), which recognizes the need for readers to transfer skills and strategies from a familiar reading environment to one that is complex, rapidly changing, and frequently poorly defined. Based on our exploratory study, the mobile world of digital stories appears to be just such a place.</p><a id="AN0095772271-3" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_12" title="The Exploratory Study">The Exploratory Study</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We used an iPad 2 and the iTunes mobile download store (<a href="http://www.itunes.com/">www.itunes.com</a>) to conduct a search that might mirror the method by which many families would acquire digital picture books for their children. First, we did a simple keyword search for "stories," which returned 7,218 potential apps for download. These results also included book readers, games, and apps targeting adults, so our next keyword search was restricted to the app category of "books." This resulted in 5,591 potential apps for download, although not all books were targeted for children.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Then, to generate a list from which any parents, regardless of income, would be most likely to choose story apps, we narrowed the search to display only those available for free download, and we then sorted the results by "most popular." From this final list, we randomly selected a group of 20 apps from the Top 200 free downloads, manually verifying that they met the criteria and that each was targeted for children and contained both text and images. Apps that did not meet these criteria were replaced with another random selection from the Top 200 free apps until all criteria were met.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Next, we coded the digital stories for the text features present, as well as for all the book-handling skills that were needed to navigate the digital text, such as swiping to turn pages and touching icons to initiate an event. The second author then reviewed the data, and we added and discussed additional information until we reached a consensus. Finally, each of these features and user actions was paired with its paper-based equivalent to obtain a sense of how far away each digital feature was from a paper-based reading environment. The inspiration for this part of the analysis was based on Merchant's work (2005) in mapping the writing task for young students across both print-based and on-screen environments which uncovered real differences underneath seemingly similar aspects of the literacy task. The complete list of story apps included in the exploratory study is shown in Table 1.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Because we sought a random sample of what parents or teachers might initially find for free online, we did not rate the literary quality of each selected story app. We do, however, believe this would be an important next step for any teacher seeking to use no-cost story apps in the classroom. Our random sample turned out to contain software from independent writers, small ventures, and corporate entities, and the downloaded applications ranged from rudimentary to quite sophisticated, not always in relation to the financial resources presumably behind the developer. Given today's open access to app development software, the simple act of publishing a children's story does not guarantee the reader a quality experience. It remains up to the classroom teacher to choose reading material that best meets the needs of students (Dobler, 2013).</p><a id="AN0095772271-4" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_17" title="Digital Texts Are Still Evolving">Digital Texts Are Still Evolving</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Analysis of our results confirmed that features such as narration and animation were present in a large proportion of the digital stories, supporting the recent findings of Guernsey et al.

All of this suggests that today's students need to approach the mobile reading experience with the understanding that there may be more than one "right way" to proceed, both across different story apps and within the stories themselves.</p><a id="AN0095772271-5" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_22" title="When Things Are the Same but Not the Same">When Things Are the Same but Not the Same</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As we moved from documenting the specific features into mapping the mobile digital reading experience onto its paper-book equivalent, it became clear that while some book concepts such as turning pages were present in both experiences, the processes for achieving these goals were strikingly different. For example, if a child wants to listen to a paper-based story, he or she must find and ask another person to read it aloud. If a child wants to listen to a digital story on a mobile platform, he or she may have a choice to independently activate a narration feature by touching a certain icon, navigating a settings menu, or touching speech bubbles that appear on the screen. Given these very different methods, it would not surprise us to find that a young reader who is either unaware of the narration feature or has not learned how to access it would still believe that listening to a digital story was only possible if another person was present to read it aloud.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The presence of external links within 80% of digital story apps in the study raised the question of young readers maintaining a sense of place as they read through a book. A paper story is self-contained, and a reader who immerses herself in its pages at the beginning will remain within that narrative until the end. This stability of place is not a guarantee within a mobile platform's digital stories, where external links can be embedded to take the reader, knowingly or unknowingly, outside of the story and into the realm of commerce or social media. A child who is accustomed to looking at paper books, or who has had only limited access and practice with digital story apps, may not be able to realize when a mobile device screen is not part of the story.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Research with older elementary students shows that strong readers activate their background knowledge of how the digital environment works as a means of staying oriented during the online reading task (Coiro &amp; Dobler, 2007). Teaching our primary students how to maintain reading continuity in a digital story that contains navigational icons and occasional hyperlinks may be one way to set the stage for this successful reading strategy. Table 3 illustrates subtle and not-so-subtle differences between the two reading platforms that teachers need to consider in order to ensure effective literacy instruction for students with differing levels of understanding.</p><a id="AN0095772271-6" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_26" title="Interactivity and Games">Interactivity and Games</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The ability to physically interact with the text and illustrations in a digital story marks a blatant departure from the paper-based reading environment. With the touch-screen abilities of many mobile devices, tapping or swiping at words or pictures can, and often does, induce animations and sounds. For example, in the digital story The Grumble Noise, touching any part of the text will cause it to glow while a narration of the sentence plays, and tapping on a cookie in one of the illustrations will cause it to appear to be eaten away until only crumbs are left. In that particular example, once the young reader touches the cookie for the first time, reducing it to crumbs is a fairly intuitive process.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Not all interactive elements are so easily manipulated by the young child, however, which raises concerns that poorly placed or integrated interactivity will hinder the intended learning if the young reader does not understand what he or she is supposed to do next (Plowman &amp; McPake, 2013). Research has found that interactive graphics in electronic story readers can either engage the students in the text or distract them from it (Labbo &amp; Kuhn, 2000; Verhallen, Bus &amp; deJong, 2006), and there has been a push from literacy experts for software designers to move toward considerate illustrations that support the text rather than acting as seductive details that detract from it (Schugar, Smith &amp; Schugar, 2013). There is also promising research underway to develop effective ways to measure e-book quality in early childhood classrooms (Roskos &amp; Burstein, 2013).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The inclusion of interactive games or other activities in many story apps is another way in which digital stories differ from paper books. These may be intended as during-reading enrichment, as in The Flying Butterfly, when the reader is asked to complete helpful actions like "[putting] the crown on the butterfly," or games may be used as after-reading activities, such as the drag-and-drop puzzles in The Fox and the Crow. As with the interactive illustrations, such activities have the power to either distract from or enrich the storyline, and teachers should consider which add-ons offer the best instructional value for use in their classrooms.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Another concern for primary teachers is how an emergent reader's sense of place within the story narrative may be either supported or distorted by engaging in these activities, depending on how they are accessed within the app environment. In the midst of technological advances, the point remains that the presence of interactivity in digital stories is a novel concept that needs thoughtful attention from teachers when making instructional decisions about mobile platform use in the classroom.</p><a id="AN0095772271-7" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_31" title="Icons and Their Changing Faces">Icons and Their Changing Faces</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Across all the stories we reviewed on the iPad, recognizing and interpreting the author's use of icons was at the heart of being able to navigate and activate various features of the story. This means that in addition to understanding the different roles of words and punctuation within a digital text, the emergent reader must learn about the role of icons. Table 4 highlights some of the books from the study to give a sense of the sheer number of different icons that the reader must interpret and potentially implement as part of the mobile digital reading experience.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Adding to the complexity of the task, rote memorization of such icons seems unlikely to be sufficient. Of all the variable text features noted in the texts in our study none was more ambiguous than icon usage. Unlike the appearance of punctuation marks, which has become stable across all English reading materials, there is currently wide variation in the icons software developers are using and in what a particular icon is supposed to signify. While industry standards for icon usage may eventually materialize, as they did for punctuation marks, software developers can now choose any visualization to symbolize the way to return the reader to the beginning of the story.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Table 5 demonstrates the many different ways that the simple act of returning to the beginning of the story was being represented by the book apps in our sample, and there are probably even more in use which this study did not capture. Clearly, a student using a mobile digital story app needs to exercise flexibility in connecting an icon's appearance to the reading task with which it assists.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Many examples of icon variability were not only seen between the books in this study but even within a single book. In one case, a book that we had previously coded as using left-right arrows for page-turning was revisited by one of the authors a few weeks later while reading with a child, at which time the arrows had disappeared and been replaced with a two-step menu option process. For a struggling reader who has not developed flexibility in navigating mobile digital texts, such unexpected changes could create roadblocks that prevent her from ever reaching the end of the story.</p><a id="AN0095772271-8" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_36" title="If at First You Don&#39;t Succeed">If at First You Don't Succeed</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As we looked at icon instability across the different digital stories in our study, we also identified another challenge for the emergent reader: what a particularly styled icon signifies in one digital story cannot be counted on to signify the same thing in another. For example, a number of the digital story reading apps contained an icon that looked like the lower-case alphabet letter i, yet the only consistency across stories was that touching that icon took the reader to a different page. The kind of page upon which one landed was a complete gamble to someone who hadn't read that particular book before, as illustrated in Table 6. As this table shows, even the arrow symbol, a potentially intuitive choice for directing a reader to proceed a certain way, is still evolving in its meanings.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">What this means is that while prior knowledge of certain icons may help a reader to narrow down the possibilities for an outcome, he or she cannot have certainty until an option is tried. Given this lack of consistency in icons across reading applications, it is clear that visual memorization alone will not provide the young reader with a sufficient understanding of icons in digital stories on mobile devices. Instead, the reader must acquire the overarching understandings that certain actions are possible and that either a single icon or a series of maneuvers is most likely present on the screen to allow it to happen.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As Rowsell and Lapp (2011) have pointed out, "when discourse shifts from print to digital media it becomes easier to use a multiplicity of modes, such as images and sounds, to signify meaning" (p. 397). As such, emergent readers must eventually learn to recognize such multimodalities as part of the conventions of reading a digital text and learn that their use requires some flexibility.</p><a id="AN0095772271-9" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"> </a><span class="medium-bold" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.orca.douglascollege.ca/ehost/delivery?vid=15&amp;sid=9ca8f90b-2eea-4342-94a8-6df0e08be468%40sessionmgr2#toc" id="hd_toc_40" title="Teaching Reader Flexibility and Persistence">Teaching Reader Flexibility and Persistence</a></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Taken together, the study findings suggest that not only do young readers need to master book-handling skills and use print features that are not present in paper books, they must also overcome the unreliable nature of each. If memorization is insufficient, then the natural question follows: How can teachers teach evolving digital text features using mobile devices? We propose that the existence of this variability itself is a key concept that readers of digital texts must acquire. The ambiguity should not be considered a problem; instead, it should be considered an opportunity to engage in cognitive flexibility as an important part of using technology. We offer the following instructional strategies for helping readers accomplish this.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">1. Create a classroom culture of openness to change:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">a. Showcase more than one kind of mobile technology for digital reading in your classroom, even if these opportunities are less available or widespread than you would like. It is likely your students will have increasing opportunities to access mobile devices in the future, so even a small amount of exposure now can plant seeds for their growing schema. One way to incorporate this strategy would be comparing a single book that is available in a wide variety of paper and digital formats, such as The Kissing Hand by Audrey Penn. Start by displaying the hardcover edition on-screen using a document camera and reading it aloud to the whole class. Then, have students revisit the same text for close reading in small groups, this time using an e-book version (if you don't have an e-reader, many public libraries have started offering them for regular checkout). Next, download the story app onto a tablet for partner use at a literacy workstation (there are both Android and iPad versions available). Finally, place the same hardcover edition in your independent listening area, this time adding an audio recording on an inexpensive MP3 player with earbuds. While school budgets and time constraints may not make it feasible to provide students with access to this many technologies on a regular basis, the key is to look for ways to offer the same texts in more than one medium wherever possible. In this way, students can become more flexible in their expectations and adapt their reading behaviors depending on the context.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">b. Familiarize students with the evolving features currently available in digital stories and the multitude of forms those features can take so that students learn to focus on the functions and not on the symbols. For example, talk about how many digital stories now have a read-to-me feature, but not all devices or stories will do it the same way. This means that good readers understand that it is probably possible to have the story read to you, but that it may take a few tries to figure out how to get that to happen. Demonstrate this by showing how, in one story app, you have to choose between two icons on the screen, such as "read it myself" or "read to me." Then, open a different story app and point out that there are no sentences like that on the screen. Show how, instead, the reader needs to open up a menu and set the narration feature to "on." This is also an excellent opportunity to call attention to the fact that sometimes the text is highlighted while the narrator is reading. Explain that good readers know to look at the highlighted words while they listen to find out what those words say. You might also show your students how, in some stories, clicking on the pictures will bring up a vocabulary word that describes what was touched, a feature that can be particularly helpful when reading informational texts.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">c. Use think-alouds as you navigate a digital text, modeling specific problem-solving strategies for your students. Then, encourage students to use self-talk as they work through similar problem-solving situations with the mobile devices themselves. When getting ready to open a new digital story on a tablet, a teacher might pretend to struggle with how to move from one page in the story to the next, and then begin to problem-solve out loud. "Let me see: when I pressed that picture of an arrow to turn the page, it went to a different page, but I'm not sure it's the right one because the pictures are all different, and now I see dollar signs and numbers that look like money. I remember our class talking about how some digital stories have advertisements in them, so I think I accidentally left the story and went to a website to buy things. I didn't want to do that, so let me think about how I can fix this. We have been learning that there is usually more than one way to get back to the right page of the story. I just need to keep trying and paying attention to what is on the screen. Now, I already know that if I press this home button on the tablet here, I can go back and start brand new, so I think I should do that Okay, this looks familiar. Hmm, how else have I seen someone turn the pages? Maybe this time I should try swiping my finger to the side instead of pressing an icon. Hey, that worked!" As students become more familiar with the technologies used in the classroom, they should also participate in these problem-solving opportunities by providing suggestions to the teacher. They can also share what they tell themselves when they face a new challenge with digital reading.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">d. Conduct conversations around the idea that technologies evolve, and discussing how adapting to change is an important 21st century skill. If teachers are on the alert for incidental opportunities, thought-provoking conversations can present themselves in authentic and meaningful ways. For example, the child who mentions at circle time that his older brother just got the newest iPhone provides a segue to collaborative conversations between students about all the things smartphones can help people do. The teacher can facilitate the conversations by making a list of all the ideas to display in the classroom. In another instance, the group of children overheard in the dramatic play area pretending to use the next-generation gaming system they saw advertised on television could be asked, "Which feature of that new gaming system do you think is more important for people to learn how to use -- the voice-activation or the touch screen? Why?" Teachers can also be on the lookout for pictures and videos in their existing social studies, health, and science curriculums that have examples of some older and newer technologies for reading, writing, speaking, or listening. Take a few minutes during that instruction to ask students what they think those devices are for and how they might look or work differently in the future, as people discover new ways to use them. This will help students see how and why technology improvements and adaptations take place.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">e. Periodically assess what your students can and cannot do while reading digital stories on mobile devices, and then use this information to inform your instructional decision-making. If you already have an assessment you use for monitoring your students' concepts of print or book-handling skills, this strategy may be as simple as adding a few lines of your own about any specific digital features that you also want to check for, such as whether the child can locate a specific story to read on a device that contains many different icons or adjust the volume on a read-aloud feature. Intentional opportunities for informal assessment can also arise, such as when a teacher takes a moment to stop by the child reading on a digital device and leans in to ask them how to do something. For example, asking "Can you show me how to go back to the beginning of this story? Oh, I see. Now, how do we get back to where you were reading when I stopped you?" can help you gauge how students' navigational skills are improving, or "What do you usually do when you come to a word in one of these stories that you don't know?" can help you see if students remember to use the strategy of clicking on unfamiliar words to get help from the narrator.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">2. Allocate time for developing familiarity with reading on mobile devices in the following ways:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">a. Supply different contexts for digital stories by allowing access or modeling on multiple devices such as tablets, smartphones, e-readers and other technologies as they emerge. If you have a digital projector in your classroom, you may be able to purchase an inexpensive adapter that allows you to demonstrate digital story app reading on a smartphone to the whole class. After reading a digital story to the class on an e-reader or a tablet, make the mobile device available to small groups or individuals during the remainder of the day, so they can revisit the text on their own.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">b. Use a wide variety of digital stories for students to access, coupled with encouragement for the students to notice the similarities and differences between the reading experiences. Encourage students to make text-to-text connections when they see the same features appear in more than one story app, and have them acknowledge whether the feature is activated in a similar or different way across the texts. Consider creating a display-sized Venn diagram and labeling the outer circles with two different mediums for reading, such as MP3 players and tablets. Have each student contribute similarities and differences they discover as these mediums are used for literacy activities in the classroom (for example, one helps you listen to the story and the other helps you listen and see the story.) For preschool and kindergarten classrooms, the teacher can make this graphic organizer even more meaningful by using photos of parts of the devices and screenshots of how different stories and features appear rather than describing it with words and sentences. Turn this into an interactive display by using hook-and-loop fasteners to attach the pictures to diagram, then remove them and ask students to replace them correctly.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">c. Provide multiple collaborative exploration and practice opportunities across the school day that encourage young readers to share with others what they are trying, finding, and learning. Even in a digital environment, instructional strategies of collaborative exploration and practice will help your students see reading as a sociocultural experience, sharing and learning together. Assign students who come to school with already-established digital reading skills to mentoring roles with students in your classroom who come with limited knowledge and experiences. Arrange to have the students in your class regularly sit and read digital stories with students from a younger grade level. You might even cast your students in the role of "resident experts" by having them demonstrate how to read digital stories to any visitors who come to your classroom (parents, volunteers, principal, etc.). Teachers often feel the pressure of maximizing the school day, so look for ways that practice with digital reading on different devices could be integrated into your existing curriculum without requiring additional instructional minutes. The next time your math, science, or social studies curriculum calls for you to read a particular picture book to the class, check the iTunes store, Google Play, or the Amazon Appstore to see if a digital version of the book is available for download. Then, instead of conducting a teacher-directed read-aloud, have students work together in small groups or with partners to explore the digital story on their own and then share out what they learned.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">3. Rather than automatically providing the solution when a student struggles with a digital reading environment, foster a sense of self-efficacy by asking probing questions that encourage</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">a. Activating prior knowledge:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"></p><ul xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><li><span class="medium-normal"> "Can you think of a way you have se en this work before?"</span></li><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><li><span class="medium-normal"> "What made you think of doing it that way?"</span></li><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"></p><li><span class="medium-normal"> "How would this work if you had made the app?"</span></li></ul><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">b.

Furthermore, the physical manifestations of these components are not stable but instead continue to be highly variable from book to book, and even within the books themselves. Such evidence suggests that a young reader learning to navigate digital texts must recognize the need to construct multiple representations of books and their features and must be able to exercise flexibility in considering and choosing between them as the reading environment dictates.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As long as technology continues to produce innovations at such a fast pace, this state of affairs is not likely to change.

Cyberlearning through game-based, metaphor-enhanced learning objects (CyGaMEs) design and embedded assessment quantify player behavior to study knowledge discovery and application. CyGaMEs is grounded by analogical reasoning theory, cognitive task analysis and knowledge representation. A construct representation argument for validity using evidence-centered design warrants CyGaMEs, its web-based learning environment, Selene: A Lunar Construction GaME, its embedded assessment, and a learning dynamics approach to student, measurement and statistical models. Two studies (US volunteers, Study 1: n = 267, mean (M)&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 15; Study 2: n = 90, M&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 12) cross-validate learning dynamics (learner progress, rate of progress and changes in that rate) for Selene's multidimensional goals while players learn and apply standard-based science about fundamental geology and space science concepts. Gameplay data analyzed using regression, calculus and hierarchical linear modeling exhibit overall relatively high standardized rates of progress toward each goal statistically higher than zero. For example, adjusting for nesting within individual players, average rate of progress toward the goal of accreting lunar mass is a z-score of 1.4 (99% confidence interval = 1.40&lt;sub&gt;lower&lt;/sub&gt;, 1.48&lt;sub&gt;upper&lt;/sub&gt;) or 1.4 standard deviations above zero.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Instructional video games have the potential to produce actionable information that enhances teaching and learning (Bienkowski, Feng &amp; Means, 2012; National Research Council, 2011). They produce volumes of data documenting human behavior during learning. For example, the online instructional video game Selene: A Lunar Construction GaME (<a href="http://selene.cet.edu/">http://selene.cet.edu</a>) used in our research posts an average of about 1700 player transactions with the game over two rounds of gameplay. However, instructional video games cannot produce sound learning and actionable assessment unless sound approaches to design and assessment precede data collection (eg, Mislevy, 2011; Mislevy, Behrens, Dicerbo, Frezzo &amp; West, 2012; National Research Council, 2011; Quellmalz, Timms &amp; Schneider, 2009; Quellmalz et al, 2011; Rushby, 2012; Sawyer, 2002/2011). Video games must be designed to cause and measure targeted learning. In addition, practical application of video game assessment is enhanced if standardized metrics support comparison of knowledge growth characteristics within and between learners, learning goals and instructional video game learning environments.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Selene quantifies players' goal-seeking behavior to measure learning dynamics. We define learning dynamics as learner progress toward the learning goal, the rate of progress (achievement) and any changes in that rate. Selene runs a Timed Report assessment to continually (every 10 seconds of gameplay) calculate and post player performance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The current research builds on earlier work that explained and contextualized our instructional video game design approach (Reese, 2009, 2012a, b, 2014; Reese &amp; Gobert, 2012) and established Timed Report sensitivity when learning goals is unidimensional (Reese et al, 2012; Reese &amp; Tabachnick, 2010).

The overview makes the case that instructional game research and implementation require principled design processes that can support an ECD argument for validity. The next sections prepare us to apply ECD to Selene and learning dynamics research. We summarize the cyberlearning through game-based, metaphor-enhanced learning objects (CyGaMEs) approach to instructional game design and measurement of learning through the Timed Report assessment instrument. Then we mathematically expand our definition of learning dynamics through analogy to physics and mathematics. We develop the equations used in our multidimensional learning dynamics analysis. We describe the CyGaMEs Selene game environment designed for the learning dynamics research program. With salient components presented, we apply ECD to support a validation argument for the game, the assessment and the learning dynamics analysis. Then we report two studies that illustrate and cross-validate a learning dynamics approach to instructional video games assessment. The two studies were designed to statistically investigate (exploratory: Study 1) and confirm (Study 2) if Timed Report data can be used to model trajectories of multidimensional goals, if the data model rate and acceleration of achievement, and if learning dynamics analyses produce standardized metrics for rate and acceleration. In the final section of the paper, we discuss the importance of the findings and their practical significance for researchers, designers and practitioners in advancing global efforts to enhance teaching and learning through instructional games.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Theoretical perspective and terminology</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Researchers, developers and practitioners approach educational video game application and research from diverse theoretical and philosophical perspectives. The goal is to distill diverse scholarship into a theoretical and practical foundation for effective instructional video game design, development, implementation and assessment. Some scholars employ a sociocultural orientation. For example, video game scholar Constance Steinkuehler (eg, Steinkuehler &amp; Squire, in press) employs ethnographic and discursive methods to study player artifacts such as players' fan-based online forums or the effect of game- and fan-produced blogs, wikis and other information sources. This line of research often conceptualizes the nature of behavioral and cognitive changes as situated and/or evidenced in player communities. CyGaMEs derives from a cognitive perspective. Research, development, assessment and implementation derive from methods that identify and measure how knowledge is structured in the minds of experts and in the minds of learners.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The CyGaMEs approach is specific to instructional video games that modify behavior to cause and measure learning. We use the term video game regardless of delivery mode (Internet, compact disc, flash drive, etc) or platform (eg, mobile device, game console, personal computer, etc). Each video game is a digital system of rules and the objects acted upon by those rules. Video games motivate and guide player decisions through goals and subgoals. Player behavior (eg, use of the mouse or a controller to select or move a game object) is the [virtual] physical manifestation of a player decision. Each player behavior is a gesture that inputs information into the video game system (see discussion of the slingshot gesture within the Selene section of this paper). Information interacts with the rules to change the state of the system. A CyGaMEs environment is a concrete manifestation (albeit digital and virtual) of the system of rules and objects. When the game state changes, the system immediately updates the [virtually] physical game world. The new state of the game world provides concrete cause-and-effect feedback to the player at the level of perceivable sensory information. Humans are designed to construct fundamental knowledge through the interplay of sensory input, transactions with the environment and causal relationships (Lakoff, 1987; Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1980, 1999). Such learning is embodied (Gee, 2003; Papert, 1980). CyGaMEs environments are designed to promote viable, embodied learning. CyGaMEs feedback also includes scoring (points-per-gesture and running score), scaffolds (short, real-time, on-screen feedback and more detailed, game-stopping messages) and end-of-module dashboards.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In a CyGaMEs environment, a player's progress toward the game goal is a player trajectory. Each player gesture modifies a player's trajectory toward the game goal. A successful gesture moves the player toward goal accomplishment. An unsuccessful gesture results in no change in progress or even failure (movement away from the goal). By design, a CyGaMEs video game system of objects, rules and goals is an embodiable analog of targeted knowledge components (for discussion of knowledge components, see Koedinger, Corbett &amp; Perfetti, 2012). Each game goal is an analog of an instructional goal. Thus, the player's trajectory toward the game goal is the player's learning trajectory in discovery and application of targeted knowledge. The shape of each learning trajectory is idiosyncratic. Shape is determined by a causal chain: decision, behavior, gesture. For example, a player with a positive linear trajectory has made constant progress toward the goal over a set of gestures. Gameplay exhibiting an aha! moment (ie, a learning moment; see Reese et al, 2012; Reese &amp; Tabachnick, 2010) is curvilinear. The trajectory would begin with a level or negatively sloped segment. The second segment of the trajectory would curve upward like a fishhook or letter "j."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">State of field</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Instruments that measure learning through data logs of behavior captured during gameplay are embedded assessments. They afford authenticity without disruption (eg, Shute &amp; Ventura, 2013). Embedded video game assessments can have high ecological validity (Baker, 2010; McClarty et al, 2012) if they measure learning performance where and while it occurs. Across the globe, research efforts seek to adapt learning analytics and data mining for educational applications (Siemens &amp; Baker, 2012). These methods are designed to analyze and leverage large datasets of learner behavior. Nations like USA invest funding initiatives to build capacity for effective embedded assessment through cyberlearning environments like instructional video games (eg, National Science Foundation, 2012; USA Department of Education Office of Educational Technology, 2010) and analysis methods for learning analytics and data mining (Bienkowski et al, 2012). As in any scientific enterprise, the best learning theories and predictive models are parsimonious (Witten &amp; Eibe, 2005). Models and algorithms are strongest when theory and prior knowledge structure data engineering (Witten &amp; Eibe, 2005). Studies must include cross-validation to demonstrate that algorithms generalize (ie, that they work and are not overfitted to a specific sample, see Desmarais &amp; Baker, 2012; Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2013). Reviewers have found that many educational video game design efforts lacked sufficient rigor to assess learning from gameplay data (eg, National Research Council, 2011; Quellmalz et al, 2009, 2011; Rushby, 2012). The efforts lack a specified alignment among targeted knowledge, the instructional game and assessment data structures. Once rigorous video game assessment measures are developed, meaningful integration of such assessments into educational practice requires some form of standardization so that achievement can be compared and generalized across learners, implementation, learning goals and video game learning systems.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">"Validity by design"</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Robert Mislevy and his colleagues (eg, Mislevy, Almond &amp; Lukas, 2003) address alignment through their ECD framework. In essence, ECD provides a "common language and representation" for thinking about, designing and conducting assessment (Mislevy, 2011, p. 6). The framework was developed from a psychometric orientation to support "construct representation argumentation for validity" (Mislevy, 2007, p. 467). The approach was motivated especially because traditional psychometrics does not readily apply to nontraditional delivery systems like video games. The ECD argument requires alignment among targeted knowledge, design activities, assessment and analysis (Mislevy, 2007). Cognitive task analysis (Chipman, Schraagen &amp; Shalin, 2000; Clark, Feldon, Merriënboer, Yates &amp; Early, 2008) provides a primary ECD tool for identifying targeted knowledge structures (Mislevy, 2011). Mislevy has applied ECD to simulation assessments (2011). Moreover, he has collaborated with colleagues to begin exploration of how game-based learning environments might align with ECD (Rupp, Gushta, Mislevy &amp; Shaffer, 2010).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Mislevy (2011) avowed that "applying measurement modeling to simulation- and game-based assessments is one of the frontiers of contemporary psychometrics" (p. 16).Why? Typical assessments consist of "discrete, prepackaged tasks with a few bits of data" (p. 16). Gameplay data files are complex and voluminous. ECD approaches typically employ some sort of probability-based reasoning with latent variables (eg, Bayesian networks) to make inferences about learning, skills and achievement (Mislevy et al, 2003) because the assessment models must support "synthesis of information from many observations" (p. 464).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our approach aligns with ECD. It allows us to synthesize information from many longitudinal observations. It may be more parsimonious than some data analytics/mining approaches and permits analysis using traditional statistical methods. In addition, our learning dynamics analyses were designed to produce standardized metrics. Studies 1 and 2, reported here, were designed to statistically cross-validate those metrics when multiple learning goals are concurrent.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The CyGaMEs approach</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Reese invented the CyGaMEs approach to instructional game design with aligned embedded assessment by overlapping theoretical and empirical perspectives from diverse disciplines about how people construct knowledge and how to design environments that support knowledge construction (Reese, 2006, 2007, 2009). CyGaMEs dovetails cognitive science analogical reasoning theory (eg, Gentner, 1983; Holyoak &amp; Thagard, 1989; Spellman &amp; Holyoak, 1996) with entertainment game design theory, instructional design theory and learning science theory. The ECD framework adequately captures the essence of CyGaMEs methods. Domain analysis and modeling are the core and strength of the CyGaMEs approach and have been discussed elsewhere (Reese, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2012a, b; Reese et al, 2012). The learning dynamics research reported in this paper applies to ECD layers conceptual assessment framework, implementation and delivery. This research demonstrates the CyGaMEs learning dynamics approach to analysis for assessment. CyGaMEs relies on cognitive task analysis to specify targeted knowledge structures. However, unlike typical ECD framework implementation and delivery, the CyGaMEs approach structures data to support the use of traditional statistical techniques to analyze knowledge growth trajectories and other learning dynamics. We present a study with cross-validation that illustrates how data structured from CyGaMEs knowledge engineering of targeted science content can be analyzed using traditional statistical methods to produce standardized metrics, such as z-scores. Because the metrics are familiar, educators, researchers, instructional game designers and policy makers can use them to support actionable assessment and evaluation decisions. Such metrics could even be used by an instructional game or learning system itself to individualize instructional supports and learning opportunities.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Quantifying learning trajectories</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Mislevy's (2011) conceptualization of learning through instructional simulations agrees with the underlying rationale for the CyGaMEs approach: By discovering and applying the correct game procedures, domain-novice players actually discover and apply patterns of targeted domain knowledge. Because knowledge of the interrelationship among domain variables is a component of expertise (Salthouse, 1991), progress in a CyGaMEs learning environment means a player is constructing foundations for expertise. CyGaMEs quantifies learning trajectories as degree of progress toward game goals (game goals are procedural analogs of targeted learning goals), measured every 10 seconds of gameplay as the Timed Report (Reese et al, 2012). The 10-second interval is nonarbitrary and derives from the unit task specified within Newell's (1990, p. 149) bands of cognition as</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* "Where knowledge is available from the environment about what to learn";</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* Where knowledge is "governed by the opportunity for acquisition";</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* Working "according to representational law."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The nature of Timed Report data enables researchers to apply standard statistical procedures, such as regression and hierarchical linear models, for longitudinal data modeling. Reese and her colleagues (2012) have previously analyzed Timed Report data to identify cognitive events for a unidimensional goal. They identified a prototypical moment of learning and demonstrated statistically that Timed Report successfully discriminates learner performance before learning versus at and after learning a unidimensional concept. The current work extends that research.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The unidimensional analysis revealed that some players exhibited linear growth trajectories and others exhibited curvilinear trajectories. We developed an approach to identify and model differences in these trajectories when learning goals are multidimensional. Following the standard approaches to model building and testing (Desmarais &amp; Baker, 2012), we planned an exploratory study to determine feasibility and a confirmatory study to cross-validate the approach.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Learning dynamics</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Our approach to developing standardized measures for learning dynamics derives from analogy to the physics and mathematics of projectile motion. We combined the analog with traditional statistical regression and hierarchical linear modeling techniques.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Projectile motion equations determine distance (more properly termed displacement, variable y in Equation 1) through the sum of three terms: a constant, a linear term and a quadratic term.

Within each player, we run two regression analyses. The first is linear and the second is quadratic. If the quadratic term makes a significant contribution to explaining variance (ie, the F<sub>change</sub> statistic is significant), then we retain its coefficient and the linear term coefficient. If only the linear equation is significant, the quadratic term coefficient is set to zero. If both terms fail to reach statistical significance, coefficients in both terms are set to zero.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">To support standardization for comparisons among players, content (here, four learning dimensions), samples, experiments and instructional games, we work with standardized regression coefficients.

To calculate average rate of learning and average acceleration in learning across participants, we apply Equations 4-6 to each individual's standardized beta coefficients to calculate the predicted values for each Timed Report within each player. Then we conduct hierarchical linear modeling over those data to calculate the averages across the sample, adjusting for nesting within player. Resultant learning dynamics averages are z-scores that can be used for comparison in learner assessment, video game evaluation or research.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Selene</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We applied the CyGaMEs approach to create Selene: A Lunar Construction GaME. We used version Selene II (see Figure 1) in our current research. Selene players discover and apply planetary geology concepts as they replicate the 4.5 billion year history of Earth's Moon. During the Accretion, module players discover and apply the concept of accretion and underlying phenomena (eg, kinetic energy and density) as they replicate the processes of planetary growth. The Surface Features module follows, and players discover and apply the processes of impact cratering and volcanism as players attempt to replicate processes that modified the Moon's surface. Selene is a single-player, online, 2-D, Flash (<a href="http://gaming.adobe.com/whyflash/">http://gaming.adobe.com/whyflash/</a>) or Flex (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex.html">http://www.adobe.com/products/flex.html</a>) environment available to players who register through an approved recruiter and provide informed consent or parent/guardian permission and assent (for minors). Selene measures player behavior at the gesture level, the level at which a player changes the game state. Figure 2 illustrates the slingshot gesture, which is the Selene core gameplay mechanic. A core mechanic is the fundamental gesture, the primary player transaction with the game. The gesture level is one slingshot gesture from mouse-down to mouse-up.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The following summary of lunar formation is excerpted from video instruction embedded within the Selene video game environment. The script was written by lunar scientist and Selene subject matter expert Charles A. Wood. Readers wishing to enhance their understanding of the Selene game may view an excerpt of gameplay in a video produced by the National Science Foundation announcing the winners of the 2012 Science and NSF International Visualization Challenge at 2 minutes, 6 seconds: <a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid2243205745001?bckey">http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid2243205745001?bckey</a> =AQ~~,AAAAnibSDYk~,b1PLRaAcEQRwyb7jSgl-I02bBbOs2NKp&amp;bctid=2257429969001 (also <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2012scivis">http://tinyurl.com/2012scivis</a>). The Selene Accretion module begins by placing the player about 4.5 billion years ago, when the Earth's Moon formed. A planetary body about one-fourth the size of Earth has smashed into the early Earth. Debris from the collision has coalesced into a ring about the early Earth, much like the ring of Saturn. The player has a God's eye view of the early Earth, the asteroids within the ring (debris from the collision) and the beginnings of a proto-moon (for additional information and figures, see also discussion of student and task models in the next section). The successful player implements the slingshot gesture by (1) selecting asteroids and imparting velocities with just the right combination of speed, direction, radioactivity and density to increase the Moon's mass, heat and radioactivity while (2) accreting high-, mid-, and low-density material in proportions that replicate the Moon's composition. Selene promotes a player when gameplay concurrently achieves three Accretion module goal states (mass, heat and radioactivity). The proto-moon melts, differentiates into layers (core, mantle and crust) and the player levels up to the Surface Features module.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Framing CyGaMEs design through ECD</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">As with any sound ECD approach, the domain model guides CyGaMEs. When applying CyGaMEs, it is identification of targeted knowledge, representation of that knowledge as an expert model (concept map), and translation of learning goals and domain structure into game analog that translate what experts know into procedural activity players do (Reese, 2014). The domain model and the alignment of the game and assessment to it provide the essential threads of our validity argument.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The CyGaMEs Selene cognitive task analysis involved iterative development of a concept map from raw session notes and diagrams compiled over 20 meetings with content expert Charles A. Wood, augmented by his publications (especially Wood, 2003) and other readings. Wood provided continuing and ongoing review through both Selene Classic (2007-08) and Selene II (2008-14). The concept map is the domain model. The Selene concept map specifies a system of 100 relationally connected concepts (see Figure 3).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The Selene game is the core of its ECD conceptual assessment framework layer. Selene is the relational analog of targeted learning goals and knowledge. The game rules, objects, goals and player progress toward achieving those goals all represent the expert model translated as game world. Game goals and scaffolds guide and reinforce players to discover and apply that relational structure. A crosswalk table maps the visual game (visual as opposed to the underlying code) to the concept map. Twenty-seven concepts relate to Moon accretion (see Figure 3). Of these, one concept is the Earth. The Earth appears in Moon accretion to provide context but is not changed by gameplay transactions. Seven concepts occur during other modules.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The student model is represented by the four accretion game goals: mass percent, density percent, radioactivity percent and heat percent. These are the CyGaMEs Selene learning dimensions. Of the 19 remaining concepts, one (radioactivity) maps only to the radioactivity goal. The remaining 18 concepts map to gameplay captured by each of the four accretion game goals. These are the four Selene accretion latent variables. Each dimension captures student understanding of the 18 concepts that comprise the lunar accretion relational system. Radiation uniquely maps to itself (radioactivity), giving it 19 mapped concepts. Thus, the four Selene goals equally represent and support the accretion concepts.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The task model is player performance. Player performance is the transaction between the player and Selene. We also call this player behavior. We define and quantify the player performance through gameplay gestures. Students transact the slingshot gesture (see Figure 2) to achieve the four Accretion goals. Selene meters (see Figures 4 and 5c) announce game goals and continually update player progress.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Game objects and rules calculate player progress toward each dimension (goal) for every slingshot gesture.

Learning dynamics algorithms implemented in the current research extend that work. Research reported within the current paper supports calibration and hypothesis testing. Learning dynamics algorithms created in SPSS (<a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/analytics/spss/products/statistics/">http://www-01.ibm.com/software/analytics/spss/products/statistics/</a>) are ready for incorporation into research efforts and assessment reporting systems.

Conclusions generalize to Selene completers. The learning dynamics 1 dataset (LD1) players completed Selene between release August 1, 2010 and November 11, 2011. Learning dynamics 2 dataset (LD2) players completed between November 12, 2011 and January 11, 2012. Selene completers tend to be US young people (mean (M)<sub>LD1</sub> = 15, M<sub>LD2</sub> = 12, Age<sub>min</sub> = 9, Age<sub>max</sub> = 42) who have experienced academic competence or success. The typical completer is raised by parents who offer above average human capital (ie, parents' levels of education compared with US averages, see USA Census Bureau, 2012), although parent education levels range from high school to Ph.D./M.D. Completers include a slightly higher proportion of white (non-Hispanic) players than the US population average (LD1 = 66%, LD2 = 68%, USA = 64%). Other completers reported a diversity of backgrounds: African, African-American, Asian, Caribbean, Hispanic, mixed, Native American and others. Although an equal number of males and females registered to play Selene, three male players completed for every two females, Χ²(1, n = 999) = 12.6, p &lt; .001, two-sided.

Selene collects gameplay behavior, player responses to nongameplay assessment tasks, and player self-report of flow skill and challenge dimensions (measures of affective response). Players complete three rounds of nongameplay assessments (pre, medial and post) and two rounds of gameplay. Each gameplay round contains the Accretion module (player forms the Earth's Moon) and the Surface Features module (player replicates the Moon's 4.5 billion year history of impact cratering and volcanic activity). The two studies reported here are part of a larger research program and represent longitudinal analyses of Selene accretion data over both rounds of accretion gameplay. The Accretion module presents four static goals (learning dimensions) players must reach to advance through three sections (scales) of increasing challenge (see Table 1):</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Scale 1. Mass. (How do particles accrete, ie, stick together?)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Scale 2. Mass, add density. (How do particle densities combine to replicate the composition of Earth's Moon?)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Scale 3. Mass, density, add radioactivity. (How does accretion include the radioactive particles that later melt the mantle for volcanic activity?) Add heat. (How does accretion cause the heat that melted the Moon in support of differentiation?)</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Meters within the Selene Accretion module guide and provide feedback, displaying scale-level goals and plotting player's current progress (see Figures 4 and 5). Selene Accretion Scales 2 and 3 also guide gameplay with an additional meter that alerts the player to the best density choice, calculated from the current composition of the player's proto-moon (the early Moon as it formed during accretion). The game provides scaffolds for immediate and simultaneous feedback (rewards or punishment) on player activity. These scaffolds do not interrupt gameplay. They are designed to increase achievement on any of the goals by flashing brief text, transient score gain or loss displays (eg, Great Density Choice, + 10!) and one of a set of short, exciting sounds. A second type of scaffold triggers when gameplay is clearly not effective, as when a player executes inappropriate play several times in a row or for the majority of a set of plays. These "help" scaffolds assist the player with core game mechanics. They include text, diagrams and sometimes a screenshot or short animation. Dead end outcomes allow a player to follow wrong courses, experience consequences and replay from an earlier stage.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Procedure</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Every 10 seconds for each active accretion goal, Selene posts to the database (1) the goal state and (2) player's current achievement. Postgameplay processing algorithms calculate player's current progress for each goal as a percentage of goal achievement. Regression analyses determine regression coefficients and then use them to calculate predicted rate (y', prime, see Equation 5) and acceleration (y", prime-prime, see Equation 6): these are the dependent variables used in CyGaMEs' hierarchical linear modeling analyses of accretion.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">During preprocessing, nonsignificant regressions are assigned a zero slope. Data exhibiting floor effects are assigned a zero slope, and those with a ceiling effect are assigned one unit more than the highest slope within a learning dimension. A learning set is one attempt to achieve a set of game goals; ie, Timed Report data from one iteration of play within a scale. Learning sets with too few measures to permit regression are generally assigned a zero slope. An exception occurs for the mass dimension within learning sets if the player achieved the goal state for mass but must continue to play the scale until the other scale goals are met. Mass dimension slopes within the interval are coded as ceiling effects. The same process is applied to calculate the acceleration (y" or progress prime-prime). Scales range from a minimum floor (see Appendix) to a maximum of 100% (1.0).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Statistical data analysis</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Statistically, we use mixed models analyses to control for nesting of a dimension's Timed Reports within player.

The first-level units of each of eight multilevel models were trials for which rate (prime) and acceleration (prime-prime) in progress toward the game goal had been calculated for each of the four learning goals. The number of trials varied among participants. The total number of trials for each goal was 40 809-mass, 29 152-density, 21 540-radiation and 21 540-heat. For each of these four dimensions, we ran one model for rate (prime) and one for acceleration (prime-prime).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These models, based on individual differences alone without predictors, permitted calculation of an average standardized learning rate (the mean within the raw data and intercept within the mixed model, see Table 2). For example, consider the mass goal.LD1 players average a standardized learning rate of 1.44, which differs significantly from zero (no progress): t(272.19) = 78.18, p &lt; .001, 99% confidence interval (CI) = 1.40<sub>lower</sub>, 1.48<sub>upper</sub>, using restricted maximum likelihood estimation (see Table 2). The minimum learning rate within the dataset = -2.87 and the maximum = 3.38, with an overall standard deviation (before controlling for nesting) of 1.2. The intraclass correlation for this model (ρ = 0.06) suggests that the rate of learning is essentially the same for all players. This explains the consistency between the mean rate of progress before control for nesting, M<sub>before nesting</sub> = 1.47, and the rate (intercept) once we controlled for nesting within player.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Standardized rate of learning is calculated in z-score units. The mass rate represents 1.44 standard deviation units in player progress for each 1 standard deviation in time (see Figure 6a). To put this into perspective, a mean rate (slope) 1.0 would indicate that on average, players progress toward the goal at every Timed Report. Rates (slopes) lower than 1.0 indicate players require multiple Timed Reports to achieve progress. An analogy to intelligence quotient (IQ) scores may assist interpretation of standardized learning dynamics scores. IQ scores have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. A z-score of 1.44 corresponds to an IQ of about 122. Out of a distribution of 100 randomly selected people, 91 would be expected to have an IQ less than 122 and only 8 higher.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The Figure 6a schematic illustrates learning dynamics slopes for all four learning dimensions.LD1 players achieved progress rates statistically greater than zero with 99% confidence intervals for each of the four learning goals (see Table 2 intercepts). Mass, heat and radiation rates are all above 1. However, rate of progress toward the density goal was much slower, intercept<sub>density</sub> = 0.39.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">While players' acceleration toward the mass and heat goals was statistically greater than zero, it was relatively and consistently low. Accelerations for density and radiation were not statistically different from zero. Together, these results suggest that during the majority of their accretion gameplay, players progressed toward these goals at a constant rate.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Intraclass correlations for the density goal rate of progress are the highest of the four models, ρ<sub>density</sub> = 0.21. Even so, the rate of density progress before nesting (M = 0.47) is very close to the intercept calculated through the mixed model analysis (0.39). Intraclass correlations for acceleration reach 0.23; however, overall average acceleration before nesting is essentially the same as the intercept values (-0.02 vs. -0.03). This suggests that variance in the model because of individual differences in patterns for rate of progress or acceleration toward the learning goals makes very little difference in the average trajectory tendencies for the LD1 sample.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">These results suggest:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* Selene II successfully scaffolds LD1 players to discover and apply targeted concepts as progress toward three of four dimensions (see Table 2).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* Players tend to progress toward each of the four goals at a fairly constant rate.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* LD1 player rate of performance toward the density goal was lower than for the other three dimensions. This warranted a redesign of the game's representation of density (compare original Selene II artwork to redesign; ie, compare Figure 4b,c and Figure 5a to Figure 5b,c).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">LD1 results support the effectiveness of Selene II for three of the four learning goals. Results also support the sensitivity of Timed Report data and the learning dynamics approach for measuring average rate and acceleration in player progress toward game goals.

We initially conducted eight mixed models analyses (rate and acceleration) as in Study 1, controlling for nesting of Timed Reports (trials) within LD2 players (n = 90).We followed these with a second set of eight analyses on a combined LD1-LD2 dataset. We ran the null model (Model 1) followed by a model with study (LD1 vs. LDs) as the Level 2 predictor (Model 2). This allowed us to test whether distinction between datasets significantly improved prediction. We report the maximum likelihood rather than restricted maximum likelihood estimates to facilitate model comparisons because the difference between two restricted maximum likelihood models does not form the chi-square distribution necessary to support a test of statistical significance.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Results and discussion</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The first-level units of each multilevel model were trials for which rate and acceleration in progress toward the game goal had been calculated for each of the four learning goals for LD2. The number of trials varied among participants. The total number of trials for each goal was 16 230-mass, 11 213-density, 8075-radiation and 8075-heat. The ratio of the number of Scale 1 mass reports to Scale 2 density reports and Scale 1 reports to Scale 3 reports is essentially the same as with LD1. This is an indication that proportions of gameplay in each of the three scales were consistent across both samples.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Results are similar to those for LD1, with two exceptions (see Table 3 and Figure 6):</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* LD2 players progressed toward the density goal at a rate of 1.27, indicating that ambiguity in representation of particle density did not appear to hinder the younger players' rate of progress toward the density goal, t(89.05) = 12.28, p &lt; .001, 99% CI = 1.00<sub>lower</sub>, 1.54<sub>upper</sub>.

The minimum learning rate within the dataset = -2.67 and the maximum = 3.38, with an overall standard deviation (before controlling for nesting) of 1.2. The intraclass correlation for this model (ρ = 0.18) indicates greater variance within the younger players' rate of progress than was found for the older LD1 players.

Intraclass correlations indicate similar variability within LD1 and LD2 players for heat and radioactivity and about 10% greater proportion of variance across the younger LD2 players for rate of progress toward mass and density goals. However, as was the case with LD1, the mean values estimates before controlling for nesting within player for both rate and acceleration are essentially the same as the intercept values.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">With the exception of density, overall LD2 performance rates and acceleration parallel the characteristics of LD1 trajectories (see Figure 6).

Timed Report data contain information for modeling learning trajectories when instructional goals are multidimensional. We had previously developed a learning dynamics approach for a unidimensional goal. By applying principles of mathematics and physics, we modified the learning dynamics approach to incorporate differences in learning trajectories and thus were able to successfully model learning when goals are multidimensional. We conducted an exploratory study to determine feasibility (Study 1). We then cross-validated the approach (Study 2).</p><ul xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation"><li><span class="medium-normal">2. Timed Report data indicate rate of achievement and changes in that rate. Exploratory analysis (Study 1) identified the intercepts that represent rate of learning and also intercepts representing any changes in that rate. Confirmatory analysis (Study 2) cross-validated these results.</span></li><li><span class="medium-normal">3. Timed Report data support quantified, standardized metrics of learner progress and game effectiveness. The intercepts identified during the two studies for rate and acceleration of learning are standardized metrics of learning progress. They can be used both to assess learners at the individual or aggregate levels and to evaluate effectiveness across game environments.</span></li></ul><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">In addition, these data and analyses quantified the relative characteristics and effectiveness of Selene game components. Overall, players spend most of their time making steady progress toward those goals. Results support and extend the calibration portion of the Selene ECD validity argument assessment layer. Instructional game design and implementation are a nascent field that requires research to build a theoretical base and design principles (Mislevy et al, 2012). Standardized metrics support that research.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Generalizability and limitations</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The CyGaMEs approach is specific to instructional games that modify behavior to cause and measure learning where (1) game, game goals and measures are analogs of targeted knowledge and learning objectives, and (2) measures quantify player behavior and goal accomplishment. The Timed Report is a timed-based measure and pertains to time-based gameplay.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We are interested in the application of the CyGaMEs research toward authentic educational delivery as game-based learning might occur in cyberlearning-enriched and individualized education today and in the future. Thus, we designed Selene as a research environment to collect and measure learning dynamics as they would occur naturally and idiosyncratically within 24/7, anytime-anywhere learning. The inclusive and authentic sampling design attracts some recruiters and players who do not meet their commitment. We limited the LD1 and LD2 datasets to players who completed the game, and the metrics of rate and acceleration generalize only to players who complete Selene.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Future work</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Based upon Study 1, we enhanced the differences in graphics representing high-, mid-, and low-density particles. We will investigate if this decreases visual ambiguity, increases player ability to discriminate densities and increases the rate of progress toward the density goal.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">We will apply the learning dynamics technique to drill more deeply into Selene data and observe quantitatively whether game components such as time, scale and game round affect player progress and for whom (eg, age and gender moderators).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Importance of findings, practical significance</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">Serious video games and embedded assessment are a global agenda. Even a cursory Internet search identifies serious games intercountry partnerships, government initiatives, and college and university programs across the globe (eg, <a href="http://www.seriousgamesdirectory.com/proj/schools;">http://www.seriousgamesdirectory.com/proj/schools;</a> Susi, Johannesson &amp; Backlund, 2007). Learning analytics (Bienkowski et al, 2012), and game-based instructional environments that cause and measure learning are now incorporated into USA's short- and long-term initiatives to enhance teaching and learning (Borgman et al, 2008; National Research Council, 2011; USA Department of Education Office of Educational Technology, 2010). However, serious games design and embedded assessment is a nascent field that tends to lack rigor in aligning content, game and assessment (National Research Council, 2011; Quellmalz et al, 2009). New measurement paradigms are required to make sense of the large amounts of data (big data) produced by technologies like instructional games (Timms et al, 2012).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">The vision for enhanced teaching and learning through cyberlearning instruction and assessment requires considerable financial, talent, expertise, innovation and resource investment. A collective intelligence approach (see Nielsen, 2011) may facilitate progress in codevelopment of foundational infrastructure and instructional game-based learning environments. According to Nielsen, for "collective intelligence to be successful, participants must be committed to a shared body of methods for reasoning" (p. 33). The CyGaMEs research agenda contribute to a shared body of methods for reasoning and development.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">CyGaMEs provides a theoretically framed approach to alignment that quantifies player behavior as a measure of discovery and application of new knowledge. CyGaMEs data produce information to model individual and aggregate learning trajectories for learner assessment and learning environment evaluation. Methods and results reported here advance the field of instructional game design and embedded assessment and their practical application for practitioners:</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* By design, the CyGaMEs approach reduces complexity and facilitates analysis. By design, CyGaMEs Timed Reports afford analysis of multidimensional learning dynamics using traditional statistical procedures.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" xmlns:translation="urn:EBSCO-Translation">* The learning dynamics approach provides standardized metrics that are familiar to educators and researchers.

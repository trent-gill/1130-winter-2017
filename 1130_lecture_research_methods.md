1. Go over argumentative methodologies
2. These are strategies for helping you situate how you want to make your argument:
	1. Historical / Anthropological / Scientific / Social / Applied / Qualitative

	2. Practical (Empirical) Research: The practical approach consists of the empirical (based on testing or experience) study of the topic under research and chiefly consists of hands on approach. This involves first hand research in the form of questionnaires, surveys, interviews, observations and discussion groups.
	3. Theoretical (Non-Empirical) Research: A non empirical approach to research, this usually involves perusal of mostly published works like researching through archives of public libraries, court rooms and published academic journals.

Sometimes research is referred to as "disinterested" - not connected to any ongoing concern (university)
Sometimes research is "interested" - vested interest in the outcome (funded by companies)
Sometimes research is "action" - experiential, world-changing, reflection
Sometimes research is "social" - approach w/ specific plan (sociology--see quantitative / qualitative below) 

Main type of Research:

Qualitative (research about specific causes, but exploratory - first step in quantitative research - small sample size) 

- This type of research methods involve describing in detail specific situation using research tools like interviews, surveys, and Observations.
- Qualitative Research is primarily exploratory research. It is used to gain an understanding of underlying reasons, opinions, and motivations. 
- It provides insights into the problem or helps to develop ideas or hypotheses for potential quantitative research. Qualitative Research is also used to uncover trends in thought and opinions, and dive deeper into the problem.
- Qualitative data collection methods vary using unstructured or semi-structured techniques. Some common methods include focus groups (group discussions), individual interviews, and participation/observations. The sample size is typically small, and respondents are selected to fulfill a given quota. 

Quantitative (research about existing data - statistics - generalized results)

- This type of research methods requires quantifiable data involving numerical and statistical explanations. 
- Quantitative Research is used to quantify the problem by way of generating numerical data or data that can be transformed into usable statistics. 
- It is used to quantify attitudes, opinions, behaviors, and other defined variables â€“ and generalize results from a larger sample population. 
- Quantitative Research uses measurable data to formulate facts and uncover patterns in research. 
- Quantitative data collection methodologies face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, longitudinal studies, website interceptors, online polls, and systematic observations.

Correlation/Regression Analysis (comparative, relies on association)

- This research method involves determining the strength of the relationship between two or more variables (e.g. are violent video games correlated with aggression in children).

Meta-analysis (reading review, looking for patterns in research be it by error or results)

- The basic tenet behind meta-analyses is that there is a common truth behind all conceptually similar scientific studies, but which has been measured with a certain error within individual studies. 
- The aim then is to use approaches from statistics to derive a pooled estimate closest to the unknown common truth based on how this error is perceived. 
- In essence, all existing methods yield a weighted average from the results of the individual studies and what differs is the manner in which these weights are allocated and also the manner in which the uncertainty is computed around the point estimate thus generated. 
- In addition to providing an estimate of the unknown common truth, meta-analysis has the capacity to contrast results from different studies and identify patterns among study results, sources of disagreement among those results, or other interesting relationships that may come to light in the context of multiple studies.


Disciplinary Research:

Arts - usually combines non-empirical / empirical methodology to make commentary on the nature of Art. Can be non-empirical, but also appear empirical, using primary texts as a kind of hands-on practice. 

Sciences - empirical modes to perform first hand research both in the field as well as in the laboratory. The applications of these areas of sciences are endless and apt for students who prefer to spend time in labs.

Empirical:

Observation: The observation of a phenomenon and inquiry concerning its causes.
Induction: The formulation of hypotheses - generalized explanations for the phenomenon.
Deduction: The formulation of experiments that will test the hypotheses (i.e. confirm them if true, refute them if false).
Testing: The procedures by which the hypotheses are tested and data are collected.
Evaluation: The interpretation of the data and the formulation of a theory - thesis

Non-Empirical:

Gut-feeling / faith / no basis for opinion other than one's own "feeling."

Basics of Process:

1. Probably already using these without knowing it, but here it is put plainly:
		1. Causal Analysis - looks for causes and results, usually results in a claim about validity of cause or result (EVALUATIVE)
		2. Comparison (Comparative Analysis) - compares two things in order to make a claim often about one of the things being compared - details need to be related and there needs to be an outcome (NOT NEUTRAL)
		3. Process Analysis - looks at how something works and evaluates how it works
	
2. Example Questions:

	1. Identify a specific problem and analyze the causes and make a claim about possible actions to be taken
	2. Compare and contrast two or more things and show how these differences are important 
	3. Consider a particular way of doing something and evaluate its effectiveness, make a claim about how might it be done better

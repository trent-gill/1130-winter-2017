**English 1130.008: Academic Writing**  
**Winter 2017 - Douglas College**  
**Waitlist**  

Please note that the waitlist for this class is long. While there is a good deal of movement (dropping the course, deregistering, etc.) during the first week, I cannot let in more students than the room will allow, which is 25 in total for the course. 

I know this course is important, I know you need it, and I know it is one of the few of this section that fits your schedule. I also know that you are a diligent student who is awesome and wants to learn and take this course. Unfortunately, these factors alone will not get you into this course. Luck of the draw will get you into the course. 

Remember to check your Douglas College Email frequently. If an offer is sent and you miss it, I cannot re-send the offer. CHECK YOUR EMAIL OFTEN.

**IF YOU DO NOT ATTEND CLASS AND YOU ARE ON THE WAITLIST, YOU LOSE YOUR STANDING. YOU MUST ATTEND CLASS TO MAINTAIN YOUR STANDING ON THE WAITLIST.**

Game Lectures:

Ted Talks: 

- What is the rhetoric of Ted Talks - how are they structured, how do they seem similar?
- What new information is foregrounded in the lecture? 
- Where are the definitions? 
- What are the dominant themes? (graphics, the brain, justifying the need for games--assumes we are against gaming--where are the videos that say games suck?)

Winter 2017 - English 1130 Schedule

Tues: Engl. 1130.004 (8:30 - 10:20 - NWS2801) / Engl. 1130.008 (12:30 - 2:20 - NWS2801)
Thurs: Engl. 1130.004 (8:30 - 10:20 - NWS2801) / Engl. 1130.008 (12:30 - 2:20 - NWS2801)

Drafting Classes are noted in the schedule below. If you do not complete the required at-home draft work in preparation for the drafting class, please take the drafting class to catch up on your work on your own. Without the required materials completed for the drafting class, there is no point in attending because drafting classes are workshop-based and require having the completed materials. If you don't have the required draft work, you cannot participate. If you attend a drafting class without the required materials, I will ask you to leave before beginning the workshop; no hard feelings or judgement.

Week 1: (Jan. 5) 

<p>For consultation, some of you might be interested in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/679/01/" target="_blank">OWL Purdue writing website</a> is a great main textbook-like site that has a lot of tips, strategies, and information about writing.</li>
<li>In my opinion, the most important OWL Purdue page for writing in an academic context is this one: <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/section/1/2/" target="_blank">https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/section/1/2/</a></li>
